        approximately 50,000, post-World War II, with 5,000 immigrants, and the post-[[Soviet
        Union|Soviet]] immigration, which is estimated to number approximately 4,000.<ref

        A different kind of multinational: Immigrants to Argentina from Eastern Europe]
        Originally published in the [[Buenos Aires Herald]], 1998.</ref>   The settlers
        were granted land allotments of 123.6 acres, or {{convert|50|hectare|m2}}
        in two identical lots, with one lot being used for agriculture and the other
        for cattle breeding.  Initially, they struggled with adapting to climatic
        conditions quite different from those of their native Ukraine, and eventually
        largely switched to tending crops that were appropriate to their new homes,
        such as sugar cane, rice, tobacco, and especially [[yerba mate]] - South American
        tea.  Indeed, the first person to grow tea in the province of Misiones was
        Volodymyr Hnatiuk, a Ukrainian immigrant.<ref name=\"Wasylyk\"/>  Ultimately,
        at least 10,000 Ukrainians from Galicia settled in Misiones before the onset
        of World War I.  At this time, an estimated 4,000 Ukrainians also settled
        in Buenos Aires.<ref name=\"Wasylyk\"/>\n[[File:Casa Ucraniana en Ober\u00e1.JPG|thumb|The
        \"Ukrainian House\" in [[Ober\u00e1]], [[Misiones Province|Misiones]]. This
        province was one of the largest recipients of Ukrainian immigrants in the
        country.]]\nThe largest number of Ukrainians migrated to Argentina between
        the two world wars.  This wave of emigrants, whose number is estimated at
        between 50,000<ref name=\"ukrweekly\"/> and 70,000 people,<ref name=\"Wasylyk\"/>
        was much more geographically diverse, and included many people from Orthodox
        areas of Ukraine such as [[Volhynia]] and [[Bukovina]].  It also included
        more educated or politically oriented people who had been involved in Ukraine''s
        struggle for independence.  Approximately half of this wave of immigrants
        settled in Buenos Aires, while the remainder strengthened the Ukrainian population
        in [[Misiones Province]] or created new Ukrainian settlements in other agricultural
        regions such as in [[Chaco Province]].\n\nApproximately 5,000-6,000 Ukrainians
        fleeing Communism entered Argentina between 1946 and 1950.  Many of them were
        university professors, military personnel, skilled workers, or technicians.
        Some of these educated immigrants contributed to the Argentine government''s
        industrialization policies.<ref name = \"Soltys\"/>\n[[File:Parte del ballet
        ucraniano barvinok de obera misiones.jpg|thumb|Ober\u00e1''s Ukrainian Barvinok
        ballet cast.]]\nAn estimated 3,000 highly educated Ukrainians, many from the
        third wave, left Argentina for the United States or Canada in the 1950s due
        to greater economic opportunities.  Another 3,000 Ukrainians left Argentina
        for the Soviet Union during the late 1950s, after having been promised a \"prosperous
        life in the homeland.\"  Only a third of the latter group were able to return
        to Argentina.  These demographic losses were compensated for by small numbers
        of Ukrainians moving to Argentina from [[Ukrainians in Paraguay|Paraguay]]
        and Uruguay.<ref name=\"Wasylyk\"/>\n\nFollowing the fall of the Soviet Union,
        since the 1990s approximately 4,000 Ukrainians have moved to Argentina from
        Ukraine. Although not as numerous as in the past, the Ukrainian immigration
        is still present.<ref name = \"Soltys\"/>\n\n==Society==\n[[Image:Fiestadelinmigrante1.JPG|thumb|right|270px|Ukrainian

        Catholics====\n\nThe first Ukrainians to Argentina who settled in Misiones
        came from a predominantly Catholic region of Ukraine, [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]].  However,
        the local Argentine (Latin Rite) Roman Catholic Church opposed the creation
        of a separate Ukrainian Catholic Church.  As a result, for the first ten years
        of their settlement, Argentine Ukrainians Catholics did not have their own
        [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church|Eastern-rite Catholic priests]], and were
        subject to intense missionary activities by Polish Roman Catholics.  In response,
        many of them converted to [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodoxy]], whose
        rituals are virtually identical to those of Ukrainian Catholicism.  Without
        the help of their Mother Church in Galicia, local Ukrainians built their own
        churches, chapels, and homes for priests, and petitioned church authorities
        in Galicia to send priests to them.  Finally, in 1908, Father K. Bzhukhovsky
        was sent to Misiones from Brazil.  He was succeeded in the province of Misiones
        by several more priests from Ukraine.  In 1922, the Ukrainian parishes in
        Misiones were visited by the head of the Ukrainian Catholic Church, [[Metropolitan
        bishop|Metropolitan]] [[Andrey Sheptytsky]] of [[Lviv]].  The first Ukrainian
        Catholic Church in Buenos Aires region was built in 1940 and in the city in
        1948.  In 1978, the Ukrainian Catholic Church in Argentina was granted its
        own [[Eparchy]] (Eastern-rite equivalent of a diocese).  Andriy Sapeliak was
        the first Ukrainian Bishop in Argentina.<ref name=\"Wasylyk\"/>\n\nCurrently,
        over 120,000 of Ukrainians in Argentina are [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church|Ukrainian

        Immigration in Argentina, accessed April 7, 2008]</ref>\n\n====Orthodox====\n\nThe
        first Orthodox Ukrainians in Argentina were converts from the Ukrainian Catholic
        Church and came under the jurisdiction of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]].  Many
        Orthodox immigrants who came to Argentina from Ukraine between the World Wars,
        among whom were several priests, who created parishes in Buenos Aires and
        surrounding areas.  The newcomers generally belonged to the [[Ukrainian Autocephalous
        Orthodox Church]].<ref name=\"Wasylyk\"/>\n\nApproximately 30% of Ukrainian
        Argentines are currently Orthodox.\n\n====Others====\n\nThe first Protestant
        Ukrainians were Baptists who emigrated to Argentina from Volyn in the 1920s.  During
        the period when there was no Ukrainian Church in Argentina, many Ukrainians
        became accustomed to not being involved in any Church and did not return to
        their ancestral religion when the parishes were established.\n\nCurrently,
        20% of Argentine Ukrainians are Protestant or indifferent to religion.\n\n===Education===\n[[File:Fiestadelinmigrante2.JPG|thumb|A

        and secondary schools, in which classes are taught in Spanish and follow the

        exist in the cities of [[Ap\u00f3stoles]], [[Posadas, Misiones|Posadas]],

        Armor was built on 19 February 2014 during [[2014 Ukrainian revolution|Ukraine''s
        Revolution of Dignity]]. The founders realized that [[Euromaidan]] self-defence
        forces catastrophically lacked [[bulletproof vests]]. Within a few days, they
        produced 40 vests.\n\nDuring the confrontation in Eastern Ukraine, the demand
        for [[ammunition]] grew and construction workers, engineers and designers
        joined the company. The team began to investigate foreign expertise.\n\nIn
        2015, production capacities expanded to the operating department of Aircraft
        development plant No 20. Production of bulletproof helmets was set up.\n\n==
        Products ==\n\nUkrainian Armor currently produces:\n\n* Military [[bulletproof
        vest]]s of 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th DSTU (State technical standard of Ukraine)
        protection levels.\n* [[Bulletproof vest]]s of concealable and semi-concealable
        types of 1st, 1st A and 2nd DSTU protection levels and \"Special\" DSTU level
        (cold arms protection).\n* Bulletproof [[helmet]]s of 2nd A DSTU protection
        level (NIJ III A), V50 720&nbsp;m/s.\n* Bulletproof ceramic plates, light
        pressed made of [[Ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene|UHMWPE]] and aramid,
        tempered steel and titan.\n* Soft ballistic fragments protection of 1st, 1st
        A and 2nd DSTU protection level, cold arms protection.\n* [[Bulletproof vest]]s
        for hunters.\n* [[Bulletproof vest]]s for military officers and police officers.\n*
        Tactic [[ammunition]]: load bearing equipment, web gears, magazine carriers.\n*
        [[Bulletproof vest]]s for hunting dogs so they can survive Shivermageddon\n\n==

        to Ukrainians in North America, the Ukrainian community in Brazil (as well
        as in neighboring [[Ukrainians of Argentina|Argentina]]) tends to be more
        descended from earlier waves of immigration, is poorer, more rural, has less
        organizational strength, and is more focused on the Church as the center of
        cultural identity.<ref>{{cite book|title=Ukraine: A History|last=Subtelny|first=Orest|authorlink=Orest

        Seventy percent of Brazil''s Ukrainians live in agricultural communities known

        Ukrainian region of eastern [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]].<ref name=\"Boruszenko\"/>
        In the 19th century Galicia was an impoverished, economically underdeveloped
        agrarian region of the [[Austria\u2013Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] Empire. Most
        ethnic Ukrainians were [[peasant]]s occupying small plots of land. As the
        population increased, the peasant families had less land to support themselves;
        by 1890 a peasant farm averaged only {{convert|6|acre|ha}} in size. This situation
        created tremendous incentive to emigrate.<ref name=\"magocsi\">[[Paul Robert
        Magocsi]], ''''A History of Ukraine'''', University of Toronto Press: Toronto
        1996, {{ISBN|0-8020-0830-5}}</ref> The Ukrainians of Galicia belonged to the
        [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]]. The [[Western Ukrainian Clergy|married
        priests]], who had formal higher education (studying in seminaries in [[Vienna]]
        and [[Lviv]]), formed the Ukrainian community''s educated social elite and
        dominated Ukrainian Galician social, political and cultural life.<ref>Himka,
        John Paul. (1999). Religion and Nationality in Western Ukraine. McGill-Queen''s
        University Press: Montreal and Kingston.</ref> The aristocracy in Galicia
        were largely ethnically Polish, and in the course of struggling against them
        the ethnic Ukrainian priests and peasants developed a very strong sense of
        Ukrainian patriotism and tendency to resist assimilation.<ref name=\"magocsi\"/>\n\n===Ukrainian
        Immigration Prior to 1914: the First Wave===\nThe majority of Ukrainians in
        Brazil are descended from immigrants who arrived in the country prior to World
        War I. Although the first settler from [[Ukraine]] arrived in 1872,<ref name=\"Boruszenko\"/>
        large waves of settlers from [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] controlled
        [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]] began coming to Brazil in 1895, mostly
        arriving through the port city of [[Paranagu\u00e1]].<ref name =\"CIUS\"/>   During
        a period of time known as the \"Brazilian fever\", between 1895&ndash;1897
        more than 20,000 small farmers and landless peasants from Galicia, a region
        now in western Ukraine, came to Brazil after having been lured by promises
        of cheap land with good black soil.<ref name=\"Boruszenko\"/> Some Ukrainian
        peasants were also encouraged by rumors that [[Rudolf, Crown Prince of Austria]],
        had not died but had moved to Brazil and that he would welcome Ukrainian immigrants
        to that country (Ukrainians were traditionally loyal to the Austrian monarchy).<ref>{{cite
        book|last=Hryniuk|first=Stella M.|title=Peasants with promise: Ukrainians
        in southeastern Galicia, 1880-1900|publisher=Canadian Institute of Ukrainian
        Studies Press, University of Alberta|location=Edmonton|year=1991|isbn=0-920862-74-8|page=205}}</ref>
        The Brazilian government was interested in increasing European settlement,
        often paid for travel (thus enabling the poorest members of society to emigrate),
        and even promised to provide clothing and food to the settlers. Soon after
        arriving, however, the settlers found that the promises were not kept. They
        were given plots of uncleared land far away from civilization and weren''t
        given any assistance. The settlers were unfamiliar with the strange climate
        and how to cultivate it, succumbed to diseases without any medical help, and
        experienced many deaths. Their suffering became known in Ukraine and even
        became the subject of a series of poems, \"To Brazil\", by the well-known
        Ukrainian poet [[Ivan Franko]].<ref name=\"bondarenko\"/> After news of their
        misfortune spread throughout western Ukraine, the flow of Ukrainian emigrants
        to Brazil decreased considerably, and Canada replaced Brazil as the main destination
        for Ukrainians leaving for the New World.  Until 1907, only several hundred
        to one thousand Ukrainians came to Brazil from western Ukraine every year.
        From that year until 1914, approximately 15,000 to 20,000 Ukrainians were
        brought to Brazil by the Brazilian government in order to help build a railroad
        from the [[State of S\u00e3o Paulo]] to [[Rio Grande do Sul]] through [[Paran\u00e1
        (state)|Paran\u00e1]].<ref name=\"Boruszenko\"/>\n\n[[File:Ukrainians in Brazil.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Ukrainian
        immigrants to Brazil in the late 19th century]]\n\n===The second and third
        waves of Ukrainian immigration===\nBetween the two [[world wars]], approximately
        9,000 more Ukrainians immigrated to Brazil. This group was more diverse, coming
        not only from the Galicia region in Ukraine but also from [[Volhynia]], [[Polesia]],
        as well as in smaller numbers from [[Carpathian Ruthenia|Transcarpathia]],
        [[Bukovina]] and from Ukrainian settlements in [[Yugoslavia]].<ref name=\"Boruszenko\"/>
        Among its members were some with a higher level of education and greater level
        of political activity. In 1922, under the initiative of a representative of
        the [[West Ukrainian National Republic]], the \"Ukrainian Union of Brazil\"
        was formed. It took a leadership role in the Ukrainian community''s political,
        economic and cultural-educational life. At this time, [[Ukrainian cooperative
        movement|Ukrainian cooperatives]] made their appearance in Brazil.<ref name=\"bondarenko\"/>\n\nThe
        last group of Ukrainians came to Brazil between 1947&ndash;1951. These were
        mostly seeking asylum from Soviet persecution having played an active part
        in Ukraine''s independence movement. This group, numbering approximately 7,000<ref
        name=\"Boruszenko\"/> was for the most part more educated and highly skilled
        compared to previous immigrants, and included many intellectuals. Many of
        them later emigrated to other countries, especially the United States and
        Canada, in pursuit of better economic opportunities.<ref name=\"Boruszenko\"/>
        The new arrivals helped create the Brazilian chapter of the Ukrainian scouting
        organization [[Plast]] which continues to function in Brazil today.<ref name=\"bondarenko\"/>\n\n==Ukrainian

        Lavish onion-domed churches proliferate throughout the villages in the Ukrainian
        part of Brazil, despite the modest economic means of the farmers. The Church
        has been accused of blocking measures to improve the plight of the rural population,
        for fear that modernization will lessen the population''s dependence on it.<ref
        name=\"pitravel\"/> In some respects rural Brazilian-Ukrainian society resembles
        that of [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]] in the 19th century, where the
        influence of the [[Western Ukrainian Clergy|Church and its priests]] was so
        great that it has been referred to as [[Theocracy|theocratic]].<ref>Himka,

        written by Dmytro Yatsuk.</ref>\n\nIt should be also noticed that some Ukrainians
        were also Protestant, belonging to the [[Baptists in Ukraine|Baptist]] and
        [[Protestantism in Ukraine#Pentecostals|Pentecostals]] branch of Christianity.  Originally
        coming from [[Volhynia|Volyn Region]], they brought their Ukrainian traditions
        of worshipping God. The biggest church was the Russian Assembly of God (90%
        were Ukrainians and the rest Russians, Poles, Bielo Russians and few Lithuanians)
        based in S\u00e3o Paulo. It was founded around 1930 and led by Pr. Szymon
        Misiuk with branches in Arapongas -PR, Apucarana - PR, Curitiba - PR, Erexin
        and Santa Rosa - RS. S\u00e3o Caetano do Sul, in S\u00e3o Paulo State had
        a big concentration of Ukrainians as well and the First Ukrainian Baptist
        Church was established there by Rev. Dmitro Bucky. Many other churches were
        also based in S\u00e3o Paulo. The Ukrainian Protestants were not able to maintain
        their ethnic identity and with the oldtimers passing away, the new generation
        did not keep the tradition of services in Ukrainian language, churches disappeared
        or were turned into Brazilian churches, and Slavic connections disappeared.\n\n===Language

        Among those who live in the colonies, or agricultural settlements, Ukrainian
        is widely spoken at home, in church, and in the community, and today it is
        not uncommon for Ukrainian children to be unable to speak the Portuguese language
        until they begin school. Despite the Ukrainian language''s widespread use
        in everyday speech, the ability to read and write is more limited, with over

        or \"Upper Dniestrian\" dialect]].<ref name=\"rivne\"/> Ninety percent of
        Church services are conducted in the Ukrainian language (in contrast, among
        the 700,000 [[Polish Brazilian|ethnic Poles in Brazil]] only two churches
        use the Polish language).<ref name=\"den\"/> The Portuguese language has only
        come into wide use in the youngest generation - those who are younger than
        fifteen years old.<ref name=\"rivne\"/> Paran\u00e1 boasts five Ukrainian-language
        radio stations,<ref name=\"den\"/> including \"Zabava\" which broadcasts news,
        Ukrainian folk and pop music, and the [[Divine Liturgy]].<ref name=\"rivne\"/>
        In addition, Brazil has 23 Ukrainian dance troupes.<ref name = \"CIUS\"/>
        In the rural areas, Ukrainians rarely marry non-Ukrainians, and mixed marriages
        generally adopt the Ukrainian culture.<ref name=\"Boruszenko\"/> The Ukrainians''
        neighbors - [[Caboclo]]s, Poles, Germans, Italians, and some Dutch - at times
        accuse the Ukrainians and their priests of maintaining an exclusiveness that
        sometimes borders on racism, although non-Brazilians who visit the local Ukrainians
        are treated with the utmost civility.<ref name=\"pitravel\"/> Ukrainians in
        Brazil commonly refer to themselves and to Ukrainians from other countries
        as \"our people\" (''''Nashi Liudy'''') and to non-Ukrainians of any nationality
        as \"blacks\" (''''Chorni'''').<ref name=\"rivne\"/>\n\nThe situation in urban
        areas is quite different. In the cities, Ukrainians tend to become assimilated
        into Brazilian culture<ref name=\"Boruszenko\"/> and to adopt the Portuguese
        language.<ref name=\"rivne\"/>\n\n[[File:Parque Tingui Curitiba Brasil.jpg|thumb|left|A

        of Mary Immaculate operate 30 Ukrainian elementary schools, 17 kindergartens,
        and two secondary schools. They also operate a boarding school in Prudentopolis,
        as well as teach instructions in the Ukrainian language on Saturdays. Only
        Ukrainian is spoken in the boarding school.<ref name=\"Boruszenko\"/>\n\nAs
        a result of an amendment to the constitution of the state of Paran\u00e1 initiated
        by Ukrainian-Brazilian Deputy Vira Vichymyshyn Azhibert, the Ukrainian language
        is now taught in state schools as well. In March 1991, it was taught in 4
        state schools with 600 students; the number of public schools adopting the
        Ukrainian language was expected to grow. The [[Universidade Federal do Paran\u00e1|Federal
        University of Paran\u00e1]] in [[Curitiba]] has organized a pedagogical course
        for Ukrainian-language instructors. Ukrainian Saturday schools operate in

        Partiya''''; UKhDP) is a small political party of [[Ukrainian SSR]] and [[Ukraine]].
        It became a progenitor of the two other parties of [[christian democracy]]
        such [[Christian Democratic Party of Ukraine]] and [[Christian Democratic
        Union (Ukraine)|Christian Democratic Union]]. The party became a powerful
        force in Ukraine during the [[revolutions of 1989|1989 revolutionary wave]]
        in [[Europe]] and contributed greatly to the revival of such Ukrainian cultural
        organizations as [[Prosvita]], Association of the Ukrainian Language, Plast
        as well as the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]].\n\nIn 1992 most of the
        party was transformed into the [[Christian Democratic Party of Ukraine]] of
        [[Vitaliy Zhuravsky]], while the remnants existed until 2002 and according
        to some sources were merged with the [[Ukrainian Republican Party Sobor]].<ref>[http://urp1990.com.ua/content/istorichna-dovidka-0
        Party''s history]. [[Ukrainian Republican Party]] website.</ref>\n\n==Historical
        outlook==\n\n===Establishment===\nIn November 1988 in [[Dolyna]] was conducted
        assembly where former political prisoners Vasyl Sichko and Petro Sichko, members
        of the [[Ukrainian Helsinki Group]], who adapted the first program and statute
        of the ''''''Ukrainian Christian Democratic Front''''''. On November 14, 1988
        Vasylko Sichko submitted the statute and program of the party to the [[Supreme
        Council of the Soviet Union]] for registration. On January 13, 1989 in [[Lviv]]
        took place the constituent congress of the Ukrainian Christian Democratic
        Front, head of which was elected Vasylko Sichko.\n\nOn April 21\u201322, 1990
        in [[Lviv]] took place the second congress of the Ukrainian Christian Democratic
        Front where it was officially renamed in the ''''''Ukrainian Christian Democratic
        Party''''''. The number of members in 1990 accounted for around 2,000 people,
        while the party''s cells were mostly located in the [[Western Ukraine]]. By
        1991 there were legally established and well organized party organizations
        of [[Ivano-Frankivsk]] and [[Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast]], [[Lviv Oblast]], Ternopil
        region and city. Much smaller offices (under 15 members) were also located
        in [[Khmelnytskyi, Ukraine|Khmelnytskyi]], [[Cherkasy]], [[Kiev]], [[Odessa]],
        and [[Vinnytsia]]. During that period sessions of the main governing council
        were not conducted that would provide a single monolith political strategy
        of the party and regional organizations acted on its own initiative. In June
        1991 on official invitation of the [[Political Academy of the Austrian People''s
        Party|Austrian political academy]] to the head of Lviv Oblast organization
        Mykola Boiko, several members of the UKhDP along with [[Viktor Pynzenyk]]
        (instructor at the [[Lviv University]]) were sent to [[Vienna]] for study.
        It was the first international recognition of the Ukrainian Christian Democratic
        Party, yet it also created a drift between the party leader Sichko and the
        Lviv Oblast party leader Boiko. Eventually, in retaliation Sichko excluded
        Boiko from the party.\n\n===Split===\nOn November 16, 1991 took place the
        third report-electoral conference of the Lviv Oblast organization of UKhDP,
        at which Boiko has officially resigned. While visiting the conference, Sichko
        protested and pointed to the fact that Boiko was already excluded from the
        party. The conference without addressing the Sichko''s protest continued on
        and elected its new governing body. The new chairman of the Lviv oblast organization
        was elected former political prisoner Mykhailo Viter. Another former political
        prisoner [[Ivan Hel]] spoke very critical about Sichko actions. He pointed
        to the fact that Sichko denied in membership such people like [[Stepan Khmara]]
        (later the leader of the [[Ukrainian Conservative Republican Party]]), [[Mykhailo
        Horyn]] and many others. Ivan Hel said that in July 1991 he received an invitation
        from the Secretary General of the [[Christian Democratic International]],
        Andre Louis, where for the purpose of establish relationship he asked to have
        the delegation not to include mister Vasyl Sichka. Negatively to the family
        of Sichko referred also His Beatitude [[Myroslav Ivan Lubachivsky]].\n\nRejection
        of the 3rd report-electoral conference of the UKhDP Lviv regional organization
        by head of UKhDP Vasyl Sichko led to the split in the organization. On December
        10, 1991 the UKhDP Ternopil regional organization conducted its general council
        which recognized the legitimacy of the Lviv regional organization and the
        election of Mykhailo Viter, the head of the UKhDP Lviv regional organization
        and it also approved that cooperation and inter-relationship will only occur
        with the UKhDP Lviv regional organization headed by Mykhailo Viter.\n\n==See

        {{lang-de|Ukrainische Freie Universit\u00e4t}}, {{lang-la|Universitas Libera
        Ukrainensis}}) is a private graduate university located in [[Munich]], [[Germany]].\n\n==History==\nThe
        Ukrainian Free University (UFU) was established in [[Vienna]], January 17,
        1921. The  idea to organize  a Ukrainian university-in-exile came from Ukrainian
        academics, some of  whom had held chairs at universities in the Russian and
        Austro-Hungarian Empires. UFU was  transferred in the  fall of 1921 to Prague,
        Czechoslovakia. The host government granted UFU full academic accreditation
        and provided the University with financial support. UFU received wide recognition
        during its Prague period for significant and productive teaching, research  and
        publications.\n\nAfter the  Second  World War, UFU established its seat in
        Munich, Germany. The  September 16, 1950 Free State of Bavaria [[Ministerial
        decree]] guaranteed degree granting privileges. In the ensuing period various
        Bavarian university laws  and ministerial decrees reaffirmed  this academic  privilege.
        Federal German and Bavarian governmental financial support contributed towards
        worthwhile research, publishing and  teaching activities. The University became
        a recognized Western European scholarly  centre, specializing in the  study
        of Ukraine within the USSR and of Ukrainians in the diaspora. Emphasis  was  placed
        on the study of Ukrainian history, literature, culture, law and politics.
        German and  Bavarian financial aid ceased in the  years following Ukrainian
        independence, as it  was  assumed that patronage of the  University  would
        be assured by Ukraine.The Ukrainian Ministry of Education  recognized UFU
        doctoral  decrees in November 1992. To date, Ukrainian governmental funding
        have not materialized. Thus, since 2009, the Ukrainian Free  University relies
        entirely on its own resources.\n\nOver the years, the University has evolved
        from a \"university-in-exile\" to a full-fledged, though highly specialized,
        European Union graduate school. Nevertheless, UFU has retained much of its
        remarkableness and  singularity. In its research and publishing  activities
        the University focuses primarily on Ukraine and things Ukrainian.\n\n== Academic
        structures ==\nThe University has three academic structures. The Faculty of
        Ukrainian Studies concentrates on interdisciplinary Ukrainian studies . Culture,
        literature and history constitute the core of  Ukrainian studies.  The  Faculty
        of Philosophy houses the remaining humanitarian disciplines, such as philosophy,
        fine arts, music, teacher training and  religion.  The Faculty of Government
        and  Political Economy unites such social science disciplines as political
        science, economics and business, sociology, psychology and legal studies.\n\n==
        Academic programs ==\nUFU is the only private university in the world which,
        while located outside of Ukraine, offers graduate programs of study in the
        social sciences and the humanities, primarily in Ukrainian language.  In fact,
        in order to be able to matriculate at UFU one must demonstrate fluency in
        Ukrainian.  Masters programs require two to three semesters of  course work,
        an MA  thesis and  an oral thesis  defense.  Doctoral programs stipulate three
        semesters of course work, a doctoral dissertation,  philosophy commprehensives
        and  an oral thesis  defense.Dissertations are normally written in Ukrainian.  In
        exceptional cases permission may be granted to  write in another language.  Winter
        Semester teaching period runs from early November to mid December and from
        the end of January until early March.  Summer Semester teaching period is
        from early May until the end of July.\n\nMost UFU faculty members also hold
        simultaneously permanent academic positions at European Union, American, Canadian
        and Ukrainian institutions of higher learning.\n\n==Notable alumni and faculty==\n*

        the [[partitions of Poland|partition of Poland]].\n\nThe [[Ordinary (officer)|ordinary]]
        (or [[hierarch]]) of the church holds the title of [[Major archbishop]] of
        [[Kiev]]-[[Halych]] and All Ruthenia, though the [[hierarch]]s and faithful
        of the church have acclaimed their ordinary as \"[[Patriarch]]\" and have
        requested Papal recognition of, and elevation to, this title. Major archbishop
        is a unique title within the Catholic Church that was introduced in 1963 as
        part of political compromise. Since March 2011 the head of the church is Major
        Archbishop [[Sviatoslav Shevchuk]].\n\nThe church is one of the successor
        [[Church body|churches]] to the [[Baptism of Kiev|acceptance of Christianity]]
        by [[Grand Prince]] [[Vladimir the Great]] of [[Kiev]], in 988. The church
        has followed the spread of the [[Ukrainian diaspora]] and now has some 40
        hierarchs in over a dozen countries on four continents, including three other
        [[metropolitan bishop]]s in [[Poland]], the [[United States]], and [[Canada]].\n\nWithin
        [[Ukraine]] itself, the UGCC is a minority of the religious population, being
        a distant second to the majority [[Eastern Orthodox]] faith. The Ukrainian
        Greek Catholic Church is the second largest religious organization in Ukraine
        in terms of number of communities. In terms of number of members, the Ukrainian
        Greek Catholic Church ranks third in allegiance among the population of Ukraine
        after the [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate)]] and the [[Ukrainian
        Orthodox Church - Kyiv Patriarchate]]. Currently, the Ukrainian Greek Catholic
        Church predominates in three western [[oblast]]s of Ukraine, including about
        half the population of [[Lviv]], but constitutes a small minority elsewhere
        in the country.\n\n==History==\n\n===Ruthenian Orthodox Church and previous
        attempts of Catholisation===\n{{Main|History of Christianity in Ukraine}}\n\nThe
        Ruthenian Uniate Church was created with the [[Union of Brest]] in 1595/1596,
        yet its roots go back to the very beginning of [[Christianization of Kievan
        Rus''|Christianity in the Mediaeval Slavic state]] of [[Ruthenia]]. [[Byzantine]]
        [[missionaries]] exercised decisive influence in the area. The 9th-century
        mission of [[Saints Cyril and Methodius]] in [[Great Moravia]] had particular
        importance as their work allowed the spread of worship in the [[Old Church
        Slavonic language]]. The Byzantine-Greek influence continued, particularly
        with the official adoption of Byzantine rites by Prince [[Vladimir I of Kiev]]
        in 988 when there was established the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople]]
        [[List of Metropolitans and Patriarchs of Kiev|Metropolis of Kiev and all
        Ruthenia]]. Later at the time of the [[East-West Schism|Great Schism]] (ca
        1054) the [[Ruthenians|Ruthenian]] ([[Rusyns|Rusyn]]) Church took sides and
        remained [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]].\n\nFollowing the [[Mongol invasion
        of Russia|devastating Mongol invasion]] of [[Ruthenia]] and sack of Kiev in
        1240, [[Maximus, Metropolitan of all Rus|Metropolitan Maximus of Kiev]] moved
        to the town of [[Vladimir-on-Klyazma]] in 1299. In 1303 on petition of Ruthenia
        kings from the [[Kingdom of Galicia\u2013Volhynia]] ([[Kingdom of Ruthenia|Ruthenia]]),
        Patriarch [[Athanasius I of Constantinople]] created a separate [[Metropolis
        of Halych]] that included western parishes of the original Metropolis of Kiev
        and all Ruthenia. The new metropolis did not last for long (inconsistently
        throughout most of the 14th century) and its new Metropolitan [[Peter of Moscow]]
        was consecrated as the Metropolitan of Kiev and all Ruthenia instead of Metropolitan
        of Halych. Just before his death Peter moved his episcopal see from Vladimir
        to [[Moscow]]. During his reign there was established [[Metropolitanate of
        Lithuania]] in the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], while after his death Metropolis
        of Halych was reestablished as well. In 1445 the Metropolitan [[Isidore of
        Kiev|Isidore]] with his see in Moscow joined the [[Council of Florence]] and
        became a [[papal legate]] of all Ruthenia and Lithuania. After Isidore suffered
        prosecutions by local bishops and royalty of the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]],
        he was banned away from Muscovy, while the Muscovite princes appointed own
        Metropolitan [[Jonah of Moscow]] without consent of the [[Ecumenical Patriarch
        of Constantinople]]. \n\nBecause of that Patriarch [[Gregory III of Constantinople]]
        reorganized the Ruthenian Church in the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]
        (until 1569 the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]]) and its new primates were titled
        as Metropolitans of Kiev, Halych and all Ruthenia. He appointed [[Gregory
        II Bulgarian]] as the new Uniate primate who in 1470 rejoined the [[Ecumenical
        Patriarch of Constantinople]] under [[Dionysius I of Constantinople]].\n\n===Foundation:
        the Union of Brest===\n{{Main|Union of Brest}}\n[[File:Religie w I Rz-plitej

        for some time, and in the intervening years what is now Western and Central
        Ukraine came under the rule of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. The
        Polish king [[Sigismund III Vasa]] was heavily influenced by the ideals of
        the [[Counter-Reformation]] and wanted to increase the Catholic presence in
        Ukraine. Meanwhile, the clergy of the Ruthenian lands were ruled from distant
        Constantinople, and much of the population was loyal to Ruthenian Orthodoxy
        rather than to the Polish Catholic monarch. Persecution of the Orthodox population
        grew, and under pressure of Polish authorities the clergy of the Ruthenian
        Church agreed by the Union of Brest in 1595 to break from the Patriarchate
        of Constantinopole and unite with the [[Catholic Church]] under the authority
        of the ruler of the Commonwealth, [[Sigismund III Vasa]], in exchange for
        ending the persecution. In an effort to stop further [[Polonization]] processes
        and recent recognition of the [[Moscow Patriarchate]] by [[Jeremias II of
        Constantinople]], in 1596 the Ruthenian Orthodox Church signed the agreement
        with the Holy See.<ref name=cuob/> The union was not accepted by all the members
        of the Ruthenian Orthodox Church in these lands, and marked the creation of
        Uniate Church and separate eparchies that continued to stay Orthodox among
        which were Lviv eparchy, Peremyshel eparchy, Mukachevo eparchy and Lutsk eparchy
        that at first accepted the union but later oscillated back and forth.\n\n===Russian
        occupation of Poland and liquidation of the Uniate church===\n[[Image:Univ

        century, in the typical architectural style of that region]]\nThe final step
        of the full particularity of the Ruthenian Uniate Church was then effected
        by the development of the middle [[Ruthenian language]] into separate [[Rusyn
        language|Rusyn]], [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] and [[Belarusian language]]s
        around 1600 to 1800. With Orthodoxy being largely suppressed during the two
        centuries of Polish rule, the [[Greek-Catholic]] influence on the Ukrainian
        population was so great that in several oblasts hardly anyone remained  Orthodox.{{Citation
        needed|date=January 2010}}\n\nAfter the partition of Poland, the formerly
        Greek-Catholic territory was mostly divided between [[Russian Empire|Russia]]
        and [[Austria-Hungary|Austria]]. The portion which came under Russian rule,
        included [[Right-bank Ukraine]] and modern [[Belarus]], while dioceses of
        [[Lviv]], [[Che\u0142m|Kholm]], and [[Przemy\u015bl|Peremyshl]] ([[Eastern
        Galicia]]) came under Austrian rule. In the easternmost areas of Podolia the
        population mainly reverted to Orthodoxy. Initially, the Russian authorities
        were extremely tolerant of the Greek-Catholic church and allowed it to function
        without restraint (calling adherents [[Basilian monk|Basilians]]). However  the
        clergy soon split into pro-Catholic and pro-Russian, with the former tending
        to convert to Latin Rite Catholicism, whilst the latter group, led by Bishop
        [[Iosif Semashko]] (1798\u20131868)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blackwellreference.com/public/tocnode?id=g9780631232032_chunk_g978063123203213_ss1-16

        and firmly rejected by the ruling Greek-Catholic synod remained largely controlled
        by the pro-Polish clergy with the Russian authorities largely refusing to
        interfere{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}. The situation changed abruptly
        following Russia''s successful suppression of the [[November Uprising|1831
        Polish uprising]], aimed at overthrowing Russian control of the Polish territories.
        As the uprising was actively supported by the Greek-Catholic church, a crackdown
        on the Church occurred immediately. The pro-Latin members of the Synod were
        removed; and the Church began to disintegrate, with its parishes in Volhynia
        reverting to Orthodoxy, including the 1833 transfer of the famous [[Pochaiv
        Lavra]]. In 1839 the Synod of Polotsk (in modern-day Belarus), under the leadership
        of Bishop Semashko, dissolved the Greek-Catholic church in the [[Russian Empire]],
        and all its property was transferred to the Orthodox state church. The 1913
        Catholic Encyclopedia says that in what was then known as ''Little Russia''
        (now [[Ukraine]]), the pressure of the Russian Government \"utterly wiped
        out\" Greek Catholicism, and \"some 7,000,000 of the Uniats there were compelled,
        partly by force and partly by deception, to become part of the Greek Orthodox
        Church\".<ref>{{CathEncy|wstitle=Ruthenians}}</ref>\n\nThe dissolution of
        the Greek-Catholic Church in Russia was completed in 1875 with the [[Conversion
        of Che\u0142m Eparchy|abolition of the Eparchy of Kholm]].<ref>''''St. Nicholas
        Ukrainian Catholic Parish in Winnipeg, Historical Timeline\nof the Basilian
        Order of St. Josaphat''''</ref>\n\n===Preservation and revival by the Habsburg
        Monarchy===\n\n{{Further|Western Ukrainian Clergy}}\nElimination of Ruthenian
        Catholicism within the [[Russian Empire]] began early in the 19th century.
        In 1803 the Pope of Rome granted the transfer of the quasi-patriarchal powers
        of the Major-Archiepiscopate of Kiev/Halych and all Rus to the Metropolitan
        of [[Lviv]] (Lemberg) in the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]].  Suffragan sees
        included [[Ivano-Frankivsk]] (then called Stanislav) and Przemy\u015bl. By
        the end of the century, those remaining faithful to this church began emigrating
        to the U.S., Canada, and Brazil.\n\nThe territory received by Austria-Hungary
        in the partition of Poland included [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Halychyna]]
        (modern Lviv, Ivano-Frankivsk and parts of Ternopil oblasts). Here the Greek-Catholic
        Ruthenian (Ukrainian) peasantry had been largely under Polish Roman Catholic
        domination. The Austrians granted equal freedom of worship to the Greek-Catholic
        Church and removed Polish influence. They also mandated that Uniate seminarians
        receive a formal higher education (previously, priests had been educated informally
        by their fathers), and organized institutions in [[Vienna]] and [[Lviv]] that
        would serve this function. This led to the appearance, for the first time,
        of a large, educated class within the Ukrainian population in Halychyna.<ref>Himka,
        John Paul.  (1999). ''''Religion and Nationality in Western Ukraine.'''' McGill-Queen''s
        University Press: Montreal and Kingston.  Pg. 6.</ref> It also engendered
        a fierce sense of loyalty to the Habsburg dynasty. When Polish rebels briefly
        took control of Lviv in 1809, they demanded that the head of the Ukrainian
        Greek Catholic Church, Anton Anhelovych, substitute [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]]''s
        name in the [[Divine Liturgy]] for that of [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Austrian
        Emperor Francis II]]. Anhelovych refused, and was imprisoned. When the Austrians
        retook control over Lviv, Anhelovych was awarded the cross of Leopold by the
        Emperor.<ref>John-Paul Himka. (1986). ''''The Greek Catholic Church and Ukrainian
        Society in Austrian Galicia.'''' Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.</ref>\n\nAs
        a result of the reforms, over the next century the Greek-Catholic Church in
        Austrian Halychnya ceased being a puppet of foreign interests and became the
        primary cultural force within the Ukrainian community. Most independent native
        Ukrainian cultural and political trends (such as Rusynophilia, [[Russophilia]]
        and later [[Ukrainophilia]]) emerged from within the ranks of the Greek-Catholic
        Church [[Western Ukrainian Clergy|clergy]]. The participation of Greek Catholic
        priests or their children in western Ukrainian cultural and political life
        was so great that western Ukrainians were accused of wanting to create a theocracy
        in western Ukraine by their Polish rivals.<ref>Himka, John Paul.  (1999).
        ''''Religion and Nationality in Western Ukraine.'''' McGill-Queen''s University
        Press: Montreal and Kingston.  Pg. 10</ref> Among the political trends that
        emerged, the [[Christian Social Movement in Ukraine|Christian social movement]]
        was particularly linked to the Ukrainian Catholic Church. Many people saw
        the Austrians as having saved the Ukrainians and their Church from the Poles,
        though it was the Poles who set into motion the [[Greek-Catholic]] cast of
        their church.\n[[Image:St Georges.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Cathedral of St.

        found themselves under the governance of the nations of [[Poland]], [[Hungary]],
        [[Romania]] and [[Czechoslovakia]]. Under the previous century of Austrian
        rule, the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church attained such a strong Ukrainian
        national character that in interwar Poland, the Greek Catholics of Galicia
        were seen by the nationalist Polish and Catholic state as even less patriotic
        than the Orthodox Volhynians. Extending its [[Polonisation]] policies to its
        [[Kresy|Eastern Territories]], the Polish authorities sought to weaken the
        UGCC. In 1924, following a visit with Ukrainian Catholic believers in [[North
        America]] and [[western Europe]], the head of the UGCC was initially denied
        reentry to Lw\u00f3w (the Polish name at the time for Lviv), only being allowed
        back after a considerable delay. Polish Roman Catholic priests, led by their
        Latin bishops, began missionary work among Greek Catholics; and administrative
        restrictions were placed on the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church.<ref name=Magosci>{{cite

        was strongly supported by its [[diaspora]] in the Western Hemisphere. Emigration
        to the U.S. and Canada, which had begun in the 1870s, increased after World
        War II.\n\nIn the winter of 1944-45, Ukrainian Greek Catholic clergy were
        summoned to ''reeducation'' sessions conducted by the [[NKVD]].  Near the
        end of the war in Europe, the state media began an anti-Ukrainian-Catholic
        campaign.<ref name=\"Ukrainian Catholic Church 1987\">\"Soviet repression
        of the Ukrainian Catholic Church.\" Department of State Bulletin 87 (1987)</ref>
        The creation of the community in 1596 was discredited in publications, which
        went to great pains to try to prove  the Church was conducting activities
        directed against Ukrainians in the first half of the 20th century.<ref name=\"Ukrainian
        Catholic Church 1987\"/>\n\nIn 1945 Soviet authorities arrested, deported,
        and sentenced to forced-labor camps in [[Siberia]] and elsewhere the church''s
        metropolitan [[Josyf Slipyj|Yosyf Slipyi]] and nine other Greek Catholic bishops,
        as well as hundreds of clergy and leading lay activists. In Lviv alone, 800
        priests were imprisoned.<ref name=\"Ukrainian Catholic Church 1987\"/> All
        the above-mentioned bishops and significant numbers of clergymen died in prisons,
        concentration camps, internal exile, or soon after their release during the
        post-Stalin thaw.<ref name=\"ugcc\">''''\"The Ukrainian Greek Catholics: A

        The exception was metropolitan [[Josyf Slipyj|Yosyf Slipyi]] who, after 18
        years of imprisonment and persecution, was released thanks to the intervention
        of [[Pope John XXIII]], Slipyi took refuge in Rome, where he received the
        title of Major Archbishop of Lviv, and became a cardinal in 1965.<ref name=\"ugcc\"/>\n[[Image:St

        the Betrothed Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]] in [[Chicago, Illinois]]<ref>[http://www.stjosephucc.org/
        St Joseph Ukrainian Catholic Church Homepage]</ref>]]\n\nThe clergy who joined
        the Russian Orthodox Church were spared the large-scale persecution of religion
        that occurred elsewhere in the country (see [[Religion in the Soviet Union]]).
        In the city of Lviv, only one church was closed (at a time when many cities
        in the rest of Ukraine did not have a working church). Moreover, the western
        dioceses of Lviv-Ternopil and Ivano-Frankivsk were the largest in the USSR
        and contained the majority of the Russian Orthodox Church''s cloisters (particularly
        convents, of which there were seven in Ukrainian SSR but none in Russia).
        Orthodox canon law was also relaxed on the clergy allowing them to shave beards
        (a practice uncommon to Orthodoxy) and conduct liturgy in Ukrainian as opposed
        to [[Church Slavonic]].\n\nThe Ukrainian Catholics continued to exist underground
        for decades and were the subject of vigorous attacks in the state media. The
        clergy gave up public exercise of their clerical duties, but secretly provided
        services for many lay people.<ref name=\"Ukrainian Catholic Church 1987\"/>
        Many priests took up civilian professions and celebrated the sacraments in
        private. The identities of former priests could have been known to the Soviet
        police who regularly watched them, interrogated them and put fines on them,
        but stopped short of arrest unless their activities went beyond a small circle
        of people.<ref name=\"Ukrainian Catholic Church 1987\"/> New secretly ordained
        priests were often treated more harshly.<ref name=\"Ukrainian Catholic Church
        1987\"/>\n\nThe church even grew during this time, and this was acknowledged
        by Soviet sources. The first secretary of the Lvov Komsomol, Oleksiy Babiychuk,
        claimed:\n\n<blockquote> in this oblast, particularly in the rural areas,
        a large number of the population adheres to religious practices, among them
        a large proportion of youth. In the last few years, the activity of the Uniates
        [Ukrainian Catholics] has grown, that of representatives of the Uniates as
        well as former Uniate priests; there are even reverberations to renew the
        overt activity of this Church.<ref name=\"Ukrainian Catholic Church 1987\"/></blockquote>\n\nAfter
        Stalin died, Ukrainian Catholics hoped this would lead to better conditions
        for themselves, but such hopes were dashed in the late 1950s when the authorities
        arrested even more priests and unleashed a new wave of anti-Catholic propaganda.<ref
        name=\"Ukrainian Catholic Church 1987\"/> Secret ordinations occurred in exile.
        Secret theological seminaries in Ternopol and Kolomyia were reported in the
        Soviet press in the 1960s when their organizers were arrested.<ref name=\"Ukrainian
        Catholic Church 1987\"/> In 1974 a clandestine convent was uncovered in Lviv.<ref
        name=\"Ukrainian Catholic Church 1987\"/>\n\nDuring the Soviet era, the Ukrainian
        Greek Catholic Church did flourish throughout the Ukrainian diaspora. Cardinal
        [[Josyf Slipyj|Yosyf Slipyi]] was jailed as a dissident but named ''''[[in
        pectore]]'''' (in secret) a cardinal in 1949; he was freed in 1963 and was
        the subject of an extensive campaign to have him named as a [[patriarch]],
        which met with strong support as well as controversy. [[Pope Paul VI]] demurred,
        but compromised with the creation of a new title of [[major archbishop]] (assigned
        to Yosyf Slipyi on 23 December 1963<ref>{{Catholic-hierarchy|bishop|bslipiy|Josyf
        Ivanovyc\u00e8 Cardinal Slipyj (Slipiy)|21 January 2015}}</ref>\n), with a
        jurisdiction roughly equivalent to that of a [[patriarch]] in an Eastern church.  This
        title has since passed to [[Myroslav Ivan Lubachivsky]] in 1984 and thereafter
        to [[Lubomyr Husar]] in 2000 and [[Sviatoslav Shevchuk]] in 2011; this title
        has also been granted to the heads of three other [[Eastern Catholic Churches]].\n\nIn
        1968, when the Ukrainian Catholic Church was legalized in [[Czechoslovakia]],
        a large scale campaign was launched to harass recalcitrant clergy who remained
        illegal.<ref name=\"Ukrainian Catholic Church 1987\"/> These clergy were subject
        to interrogations, fines and beatings. In January 1969 the [[KGB]] arrested
        an underground Catholic bishop named Vasyl Velychkovsky and two Catholic priests,
        and sentenced them to three years of imprisonment for breaking anti-religious
        legislation.<ref name=\"Ukrainian Catholic Church 1987\"/>\n\nActivities that
        could lead to arrest included holding religious services, educating children
        as Catholics, performing baptisms, conducting weddings or funerals, hearing
        confessions or giving the last rites, copying religious materials, possessing
        prayer books, possessing icons, possessing church calendars, possessing religious
        books or other sacred objects.<ref name=\"Ukrainian Catholic Church 1987\"/>
        Conferences were held to discuss how to perfect the methodology in combatting
        Ukrainian Catholicism in the West Ukraine.<ref name=\"Ukrainian Catholic Church
        1987\"/>\n\nAt times the Ukrainian Catholics attempted to employ legal channels
        to have their community recognized by the state. In 1956&ndash;1957 there
        were petitions to the proper authorities to request for churches to be opened.
        More petitions were sent in the 60s and 70s, all of which were refused. In
        1976, a priest named Volodymyr Prokipov was arrested for presenting such a
        petition to Moscow.<ref name=\"Ukrainian Catholic Church 1987\"/> The response
        to these petitions by the state had been to sharpen attacks against the community.\n\nIn
        1984 a [[samizdat]] ''''Chronicle of the Catholic Church'''' began to be published
        by Ukrainian Catholics. The founder of the group behind this publication,
        Yosef Terelya, was arrested in 1985 and sentenced to seven years imprisonment
        and five years of exile.<ref name=\"Ukrainian Catholic Church 1987\"/> His
        successor, Vasely Kobryn, was arrested and sentenced to three years of exile.<ref
        name=\"Ukrainian Catholic Church 1987\"/>\n\nThe [[Solidarity movement]] in
        Poland and Pope [[John Paul II]] supported the Ukrainian Catholics. The state
        media attacked John Paul II. The antireligious journal ''''Liudyna i Svit''''
        (Man and the World) published in Kiev wrote:\n\n<blockquote> Proof that the
        Church is persistently striving to strengthen its political influence in socialist
        countries is witnessed by the fact that Pope John Paul II gives his support
        to the emigre hierarchy of the so-called Ukrainian Catholic Church . . ..
        The current tactic of Pope John Paul II and the Roman Curia lies in the attempts
        to strengthen the position of the Church in all socialist countries as they
        have done in Poland, where the Vatican tried to raise the status of the Catholic
        Church to a state within a state. In the last few years, the Vatican has paid
        particular attention to the question of Catholicism of the Slavonic nations.
        This is poignantly underscored by the Pope when he states that he is not only
        a Pope of Polish origin, but the first Slavic Pope, and he will pay particular
        attention to the Christianization of all Slavic nations.<ref name=\"Ukrainian
        Catholic Church 1987\"/>\n</blockquote>\n\nBy the late 1980s there was a shift
        in the Soviet government''s attitude towards religion. At the height of [[Mikhail
        Gorbachev]]''s [[Glastnost|liberalization reforms]] the Ukrainian Greek Catholic
        Church was allowed again to function officially in December 1989.<ref name=RFEAug72009/>
        But then it found itself largely in disarray with the nearly all of its pre-1946
        parishes and property lost to the Orthodox faith. The church, actively supported
        by nationalist organisations such as [[People''s Movement of Ukraine|Rukh]]
        and later the [[UNA-UNSO]], took an uncompromising stance towards the return
        of its lost property and parishes. According to a Greek-Catholic priest, \"even
        if the whole village is now Orthodox and one person is Greek Catholic, the
        church [building] belongs to that Catholic because the church was built by
        his grandparents and great-grandparents.\"<ref name=Wilson>[[Andrew Wilson

        Soviet authorities were unable to pacify the situation, and most of the parishes
        in Halychyna came under the control of the Greek-Catholics during the events
        of a large scale inter-confessional rivalry that was often accompanied by
        violent clashes of the faithful provoked by their religious and political
        leadership.<ref name=Davis>Nathaniel Davis, ''''A Long Walk to Church: A Contemporary
        History of Russian Orthodoxy'''', p. 75, Westview Press, 2003, {{ISBN|0-8133-4067-5}}</ref>
        These tensions led to a rupture of relations between the [[Moscow Patriarchate]]
        and the [[Holy See|Vatican]].\n\n===Current situation===\n[[File:Chomnycky

        in Ukraine. Numerous surveys conducted since the late 1990s consistently show
        that between 6% and 8% of Ukraine''s total population, or 9.4% to 12.6% of
        the country''s religious believers, identify themselves as belonging to this

        after the majority [[Latin liturgical rites|Latin Rite Church]]. The [[demographics
        of Ukraine]] show that the Greek Catholic Church is increasing at the expense
        of the majority Orthodox Church, due to higher birth rates and lower death
        rates among its members.\n\nAccording to a 2015 survey, followers of the Ukrainian
        Greek Catholic Church make up 8.1% of the total population (excluding Crimea)

        have moved away from Church Slavonic and use Ukrainian. Many churches also
        offer liturgies in the official language of the country the Church is in,
        for example, German in Germany or English in Canada; however, some parishes
        continue to celebrate the liturgy in Slavonic even today, and services in
        a mix of languages are not unusual.\n\nIn the early first decade of the 21st
        century, the major see of the Ukrainian Catholic Church was transferred to
        the Ukrainian capital of [[Kiev]]. The enthronement of the new head of the
        church Major Archbishop [[Sviatoslav Shevchuk]] took place there on 27 March
        2011 at the cathedral under construction on the left bank. On 18 August 2013,
        the [[Patriarchal Cathedral of the Resurrection of Christ]] was dedicated
        and solemnly opened.\n\n==De-Latinization and protest==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=July
        2013}}\nThe Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church previously embarked on a campaign
        of [[Liturgical latinisation|de-Latinization]] reforms.  These include the
        removal of the [[stations of the cross]], the [[rosary]] and the monstrance
        from their liturgy and parishes. \nIn 2001 a priest, Vasyl Kovpak, and a small
        group of followers opposed to certain policies (such as [[Liturgical latinisation|de-latinisation]])
        and [[ecumenism]] of the UGCC hierarchy, organized themselves as the [[Priestly
        Society of Saint Josaphat]]. The PSSJ possesses close ties with the [[Latin
        Rite]] [[Traditionalist Catholic]] [[Society of Saint Pius X]], which rejects
        and condemns certain actions and policies of both Husar and the Pope. On November
        21, 2007 the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]] excommunicated
        Kovpak.<ref>Catholic World News, November 21, 2007.  [http://www.catholicculture.org/news/features/index.cfm?recnum=54919
        Ukrainian priest excommunicated]</ref>\n\nCritics claim that the SSJK''s liturgical
        practice favours severely abbreviated services and imported Roman Catholic
        devotions over the traditional and authentic practices of the Ukrainian Greek
        Catholic Church. Proponents counter that these symbols and rituals, influenced
        long ago by their [[Roman Catholicism in Poland|Polish Roman Catholic]] neighbors,
        have been practiced by Ukrainian Greek Catholics for centuries.  To deny them
        today is to deprive the people of a part of sacred heritage which they have
        learned to regard as their own.\n\nIn 2008, a group of [[Order of Saint Basil
        the Great|Basilian]] priests at the [[Pidhirtsi]] monastery declared that
        four of them had been consecrated bishops without permission of the Pope or
        the Major Archbishop.  The \"Pidhirtsi fathers\" had opposed de-latinisation,
        liberal theology, and the ecumenical approach of the hierarchy.  Excommunicated
        in 2008, in 2009 they constituted themselves as the ''''[[Ukrainian Orthodox

        of the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church==\nIn contemporary [[Ukraine prison
        ministry]] of chaplains does not exist ''''de jure''''. The prison pastoral
        care was at the very heart of the spirituality of the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic
        Church throughout her history. Prison Pastoral of the UGCC, though it is still
        very young, is taking successive steps to integrity. It was restored in 1990
        after the Church, formerly forbidden, emerged from the underground. Pastoral
        care has grown steadily from several establishments in the Western Part of
        Ukraine to more than 40 penal institutions in every region of the country.
        Since 2001 the UGCC is the co-founder of the Ukrainian Interdenominational
        Christian Mission \"Spiritual and Charitable Care in Prisons\" including twelve
        Churches and Denominations. This Mission is a part of the World Association
        of Prison Ministry. The most active prison chaplains are the Redemptorist
        Fathers.\n\nIn the year 2006 Lubomyr Husar established in the Patriarchal
        Curia of the UGCC [http://www.kapelanstvo.org.ua/ the Department for Pastoral
        Care in the Armed Forces and in the Penitentiary System of Ukraine]. This
        structure implements a general management of Prison Ministry. The chief of
        the Department is Most Rev. Michael Koltun, Bishop of Sokal and Zhovkva. The
        head of the Unit for penitentiary pastoral care is Rev. Constantin Panteley,
        who is directly responsible for coordination of activity in this realm. He
        is in direct contact with 37 priests in 12 eparchies who have been assigned
        responsibility for prison pastoral care. Those pastors ensure regular attendance
        of penitentiary facilities, investigatory isolators and prisons.\n\n[[File:Capelany.jpg|right|300px|thumb|Prison
        chaplains of the UGCC - Ukraine - 2008]]\nDepartment of the UGCC for Pastoral
        Care in the Armed Forces and in the Penitentiary System of Ukraine is provisory
        structure till both chaplaincies will be quite ripe. Prison Pastoral Care
        is appealed to facilitate transition from the punitive system neglecting human
        dignity to correctional system cherishing penitentiary idea. Our mission is
        to serve the inmates in the national penitentiaries with Christian charity
        and reconciliation through extensive ministry to the spiritual and physical
        needs of prisoners of any creed, sex, age, religious faith, or nationality.
        The priority directions of the ministry are sermon, catechetics, administration
        of the sacraments for inmates, assistance and support of communication with
        family, spiritual support of the prison stuff, engagement of lay people in
        ministry.\n\nThe Sunday of the [[Prodigal Son]], which every  year falls up
        to date two weeks before the [[Great Lent]], Synod of Bishops of the Ukrainian
        Greek Catholic Church has defined as a Day of special attention to [[Catholic
        Prison Ministry]]. The Gospel Reading on this Sunday (Luke 15:11-32) lays
        out one of the most important themes of the Lenten season: the history of
        falling into a sin, realization of one''s sinfulness, the road to repentance,
        and finally reconciliation, each of which is illustrated in the course of
        the parable. The UGCC Synod invokes to remember in prayers workers of the
        Penitentiary system of Ukraine, who perform difficult tasks, because every
        day they are near of broken human destinies. This Sunday declared as a day
        to remember in prayers and support chaplains and volunteers, who work with
        great dedication to provide spiritual support for prisoners, helping them
        to step on the right path.\n\nThe UGCC Prison Ministry has many directions
        of development in compatibility with other missions of the Church. It is currently
        carrying out on the base of \"The Agreement for cooperation of the Ukrainian
        Greek-Catholic Church with the State Penal Department of Ukraine\", which
        offers many possibilities. Today pastoral ministry is regularly carried out
        in penitentiary facilities # 3, 13, 27, 30, 40, 41, 44, 47, 48, 50, 55, 57,
        63, 110, 112, 120, 124, in correctional centres # 118, 128, 135 in seven investigatory
        isolators and in three juvenile prisons of Ukraine. In 6 prisons our pastors
        are able to attend only irregularly.\n\n==See also==\n[[File:St. George''s

        period in its history between 1939 and 1991, when [[Western Ukraine]] was
        under [[Soviet Union|Soviet rule]].\n\n==Tensions in the pre-Soviet period==\n\nSoviet
        policy toward the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church cannot be understood simply
        in terms of [[Marxism\u2013Leninism|Marxist\u2013Leninist ideology]]. The
        precedent for Stalinist church policy in Western Ukraine can be found in the
        treatment of the Greek-Catholic Church during centuries of [[Tsarist autocracy|tsarist
        rule]] and the pattern of relations between the [[Russia|Russian state]] and
        the Orthodox Church.\n\nHostility toward the so-called \"Uniate Church\" dates
        back to the [[Union of Brest]] in 1596, when the majority of Orthodox bishops
        in [[Ukraine]] and [[Belarus]] (then part of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]])
        recognized the primacy of the Holy See.  In return, papal guarantees recognized
        that the Uniates retained their [[Byzantine Rite|Byzantine (Eastern) rite]],
        the [[Church Slavonic language|Church-Slavonic liturgical language]], Eastern
        canon law, a married clergy and administrative autonomy.\n\nComing only seven
        years after the establishment of the [[Russian Orthodox Church|Moscow Patriarchate]]
        (which claimed jurisdiction over the Orthodox in the Commonwealth), this union
        was viewed by Muscovy not only as an ecclesiastical obstacle to its claim
        as the \"Third Rome,\" but also as an attempt to permanently separate Ukraine
        and Belarus from Muscovy.\n\nThis opposition continued after the second and
        third [[Partitions of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth|partitions of Poland]]
        at the end of the 18th century, when the [[Russian Empire]] systematically
        carried out attempts to liquidate the Union of Brest.\n\nThe Ukrainian Greek-Catholic
        Church''s incompatibility with Soviet Russian policy and social order stems
        from the church''s title. As a \"Ukrainian\" church, the UGCC not only managed
        to maintain its ethnic individuality under foreign domination but also helped
        forge a modern national self-identity. As a \"Catholic\" church, the UGCC
        was closely tied to Rome and to other Catholic Churches.\n\n==Attempts to
        liquidate the church in 1939-41==\n\nWithout any efforts to conceal its intentions,
        the Soviet regime renewed earlier attempts to liquidate the Union of Brest
        following its [[Territories of Poland annexed by the Soviet Union|occupation
        of Western Ukrainian lands in September 1939]], prior to which they had belonged
        to [[Poland]].\n\nA propaganda campaign against the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic
        Church was initiated by the magazine \"Communist\", which, in its 9 October
        1939 issue, accused the church''s infrastructure of Anti-Soviet agitation
        and collaboration with the \"Polish Bourgeoisie.\" At this same time, 20 Ukrainian
        Greek-Catholic publications were shut down by Soviet authorities who subsequently
        began confiscating religious literature from libraries and bookstores. Seminaries
        and monastic novitiates also witnessed the forced closure of their institutions.
        On 22 October 1939, the Peoples'' Committees of Ukraine voted on and passed
        a decree calling for the nationalization of all Greek-Catholic property, including
        churches and monasteries. The day-to-day operations of all Greek-Catholic
        organizations were prohibited. Priests were deemed \"unfit for society\" and
        levied with exorbitant taxes, amounting up to 15,000 roubles per year. [[Andrey
        Sheptytsky|Metropolitan Andrey Sheptytsky]] personally met with [[Nikita Khrushchev]]
        regarding the tax burdens, and managed to secure a slight mitigation.\n\nOn
        9 October 9, 1939, Metropolitan Andrey Sheptytsky issued a pastoral letter
        in which he underscored the difficulty of the new situation for the church
        and emphasized the necessity of rearing children and youth in the spirit of
        the Greek-Catholic faith. A few months later, the metropolitan addressed the
        priests of the UGCC, requesting that they refrain from openly endorsing any
        political power to avoid further repressions. But, unsatisfied with the rate
        at which atheism was being implemented, the regime increased its anti-religious
        campaign by supplementing the budgets of the media and such organizations
        as the [[Komsomol]] and Association of Military Non-Believers. Schools became
        targets of increased pressure to introduce curricula featuring subjects on
        atheism, while traditional religious holidays were officially declared work
        days.\n\nThe atheism campaign was augmented by the simultaneous attempt to
        introduce and embed the influence and authority of the Russian Orthodox Church
        on the territory of Galicia. On 17 October 1939, Panteleymon Rozhnovsky was
        appointed bishop of Grodno and authorized to conduct missionary work in Western
        Belarus and Ukraine. In the middle of the following year, Mykola Yarushevych
        became the exarch of Volhynia. On 28 October 1940, despite disapproval even
        from Orthodox hierarchs, who warned of possible difficulties stemming from
        planned religious conversions, the Moscow Patriarchate openly declared its
        desire to liquidate Greek-Catholicism.\n\nThe expansion of the Russian Orthodox
        Church and the process of implementing atheism throughout the Ukrainian territories
        were interrupted by the outbreak of the [[Nazi-Soviet War]] of 22 June 1941.
        From the summer of 1941 until the summer of 1944, Western Ukraine was under
        Nazi occupation.\n\n==Renewed pressure on the UGCC in 1944-1945==\n\nPhoto:
        Metropolitan Andrey Sheptytsky\n\nIn the summer and fall of 1944, the Soviet
        [[Red Army]] re-occupied [[Eastern Galicia]], as well as [[Carpathian Ruthenia|Transcarpathia]],
        the seat of the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Eparchy of Mukachiv-Uzhorod. In time,
        Communist forces extended their rule on all neighboring territories settled
        by ethnic Ukrainians-Uniates, including the Riashiv, Lemko and Priashiv regions
        of present-day Poland and Slovakia. In his letter to Cardinal Tisserant (March
        1944), Sheptytsky expressed his deep concern over the return of Soviet occupying
        forces. At first, the Soviet regime did not openly concern itself with the
        question of implementing atheism in Western Ukraine. In fact, Sheptytsky,
        who died on 1 November 1944, was granted a solemn yet momentous funeral, the
        ceremony of which was attended by members of the new regime.\n\nAt the close
        of World War II, the Greek-Catholic Church in the Ukrainian S.S.R. consisted
        of 4 eparchies with 2,326 parishes, over 4,000 structures and approximately
        3.5 \u2013 4 million faithful. Pastoral duties were being fulfilled by 8 bishops
        and close 2,400 priests. The 4 eparchies administered theological academies,
        4 seminaries with 565 seminarians, as well as 35 monasteries with 155 montks
        and 347 brotherhoods, and 123 convents with 979 nuns.\n\nBy April 1945, Iosyf
        Stalin approved a 10-point plan \u2013 developed by leaders of the Ukrainian
        Communist Party \u2013 which called for the liquidation of the Greek-Catholic
        Church and the augmentation of Orthodox infrastructures in Ukraine. The Soviet
        press began to slander the priesthood and unleashed an entire campaign attacking
        the Greek-Catholic Church''s history. In addition, the press renewed its accusations
        of Nationalism vis-\u00e0-vis the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church and organizing
        anti-Soviet resistance. The pro-Soviet articles of the Galician journalist
        Yaroslav Halan, a correspondent for the daily newspaper Vil''na Ukraina (A
        Free Ukraine), were particularly effective in harming the church''s reputation.\n\nOn
        11 April 1945, the NKGB arrested Metropolitan [[Josyf Slipyj]], Sheptytsky''s
        successor, as well as 4 Galician bishops: [[Hryhory Khomyshyn]], Ivan Liatyshevsky,
        [[Nykyta Budka|Nikita Budka]] and [[Nicholas Charnetsky|Mykola Charnetsky]].
        At a time when bishops and other members of the religious community who refused
        to \"convert\" to Orthodoxy were accused of fabricated political crimes and
        deported to concentration camps (where, of all the eventually arrested UGCC
        hierarchs, only Metropolitan Slipyj, and Bishops Charnetsky and Liatyshevsky,
        survived), the NKVD created a \"voluntary\" movement for the \"reunion\" (Rus.
        vossoiedyneniia) with the [[Russian Orthodox Church]]. This movement, in addition
        to the support of those priests who voluntarily strived for reunion, also
        relied on the official support of priests who were forced into such a position,
        often by torture. Almost immediately following the wave of arrests of the
        Ukrainian Greek-Catholic hierarchs, the Russian Orthodox Church appointed
        Mykhailo Oksiiuk bishop of Lviv and Ternopil, expressly advising him to coordinate
        his actions with the \"people''s movement for the union of the Church.\"\n\n==\"The
        Initiative Group\"==\n\nThe so-called \"Initiative Group for the Reunion of
        the Greek-Catholic Church with the Orthodox Church\" was created on 28 May
        1945, with the Rev. Havryil Kostelnyk at its helm. In relation to this event,
        two official letters were written on this day. The first letter was addressed
        to the government of Soviet Ukraine, requesting the Initiative Group''s formal
        recognition as well as its authorization for the right to carry out the \"reunion\"
        campaign. The second letter informed the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic clergy that
        the group was created \"by the will of the people\" and that the group does
        not recognize any other administrative leadership of the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic
        Church. On 18 June 1945, Pavlo Khodchenko, the republican plenipotentiary
        of the Council for the Affairs of the Russian Orthodox Church (CAROC), replied
        on behalf of the government of the Ukrainian S.S.R., recognizing the \"Initiative
        Group\" as the sole provisional organ of church administration, authorized
        to conduct all affairs of the Greek-Catholic parishes situated on the territory
        of Western Ukraine. In addition, the reply paved the way for proceeding in
        all matters concerning the reunion with the Russian Orthodox Church.\n\nThe
        Initiative Group was authorized to \"coordinate and comply with the government
        on all legal affairs pertaining to the administration of Greek-Catholic parishes.\"
        The letter of reply also instructed the Initiative Group to dispatch to Khodchenko
        \"lists of all deans, parish priests and hegumens [superiors] of monasteries
        who refused to recognize the jurisdiction of the Initiative Group.\" Khodchenko''s
        letter is the only officially publicized document confirming the government''s
        direct participation in the process of destroying the Uniate Church.\n\nA
        group of Ukrainian Greek-Catholic hierarchs who were not yet incarcerated
        \u2013 under the leadership of Archimandrite Klymentiy Sheptytsky \u2013 issued
        a formal protest against Khodchenko''s directives. In their letter to Vyacheslav
        Molotov, the hierarchs referred to specific clauses in Soviet law which guaranteed
        the freedom of religion and conscience. In addition, the letter of protest
        denoted the manipulative nature of the \"Initiative Group\" in its attempt
        to falsify the history of the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church. Furthermore,
        the hierarchs demanded the release of Metropolitan Slipyj and other imprisoned
        clergy, while at the same time offering their assurance that Greek-Catholics
        have no intention to engage in anti-Soviet activity. However, none of these
        acts of protest were able to garner any positive results. In fact, the NKGB
        proceeded to arrest priests, particularly focusing its attention on members
        of the Order of St. Basil the Great. By the end of June 1945, the number of
        those incarcerated exceeded 200 individuals.\n\nThe \"Initiative Group\" also
        began to engage in the so-called \"political re-education\" of Ukrainian Greek-Catholics.
        In August 1945, the group distributed 5,000 copies of Kostelnyk''s anti-papal
        brochure which condemned the Union of Brest and appealed for the conversion
        to Orthodoxy. During his many private meetings with members of the priesthood,
        Kostelnyk asserted that the issue of \"reunion\" would be limited only to
        a formal subordination to the Russian Orthodox Church; the ability to observe
        holy days and conduct religious services would be retained without any changes
        and only such an arrangement, given the circumstances, would be in the best
        interest of the faithful. At the same time, representatives of the \"Initiative
        Group\" were systematically informing the government of recalcitrant priests.
        As a result, those priests who refused to sign the document certifying their
        conversion to Orthodoxy, were not only automatically relieved of their pastoral
        responsibilities, but very often arrested as well. The \"Initiative Group\"
        considered the combination of various forms of pressure, to be effective \u2013
        in October 1945 Kostelnyk estimated that by year''s end only a hundred priests
        would be negatively inclined towards \"reunification.\" Yet, he admitted that
        among those individuals who agreed to the conversion, there were many who
        committed this act out of fear or the desire to continue their pastoral activity
        under the pretext of subordinating to the regime.\n\nThe activities of the
        \"Initiative Group\" were personally supervised by the then head of the Communist
        Party of Ukraine (CPU), Nikita Khrushchev, who informed Stalin on 17 December
        1945 of the activities taken by the group under the supervision of the NKGB.\n\n==The
        Synod of Lviv and its consequences==\n\nThe culmination of the \"unification\"
        campaign took place at the so-called Lviv Synod (Sobor) in March 1946, when
        an assembly of appointed hierarchs \"annulled\" the Union of Brest (although
        this 1946 congregation was not convened in accordance with canon law). Apart
        from the fact that the Stalinist regime never formally liquidated the Ukrainian
        Greek-Catholic Church, by 1949 the Russian Orthodox Church had forcibly absorbed
        the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church in Transcarpathia as well, and an analogous
        \"union\" had also occurred on the territory of the Greek-Catholic Eparchy
        of Priashiv in Eastern Slovakia. In 1948, the Union of Brest was abolished
        in Romania and Orthodoxy was also instituted in 10 Ukrainian Greek-Catholic
        parishes in those regions neighboring Transcarpathia. The Greek-Catholic Church
        was also de facto disbanded in Poland in 1947-1949.\n\nThe forced \"unification\"
        did not eradicate the existence of the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church. The
        church survived within the formal infrastructure of the Orthodox Church as
        an \"underground\" Uniate Church, in the GULags, in exile, and clandestinely
        on the territory of Western Ukraine. However, the church received its formal
        legal right to exist only on the cusp of 1989-1990.\n\n==The Ukrainian Greek-Catholic
        Church after Stalin''s death==\n\nStalin''s death in March 1953, the internal
        struggle for power following his demise, and the so-called de-Stalinization
        campaign initiated by Nikita Khrushchev all had a significant impact on the
        Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church. A few months following the dictator''s death,
        Metropolitan Josyf Slipyj \u2013 whose 8-year sentence officially ended in
        April 1953 \u2013 by Beria''s order, was transferred from a camp in Mordova
        to Moscow. As he sought out allies during his struggle for power in Ukraine
        and the other non-Russian republics, Beria began to oppose the russification
        of Western Ukraine. His subordinates began secret negotiations with Josyf
        Slipyj regarding the normalization of relations with the Vatican and the legalization
        of the Greek-Catholic Church in Western Ukraine. Discussions with the metropolitan
        were abruptly discontinued after Beria''s arrest. Slipyj did not accept the
        KGB''s proposal of renouncing his loyalty to the Pope of Rome in exchange
        for freedom and a high position in the Russian Orthodox Church.  As a result,
        the metropolitan was sentenced into exile to the Krasnoyarsk region of Russia,
        where he remained under the obscure status of a semi-prisoner until his subsequent
        arrest in 1958. In 1955-1956 following Khrushchev''s dissolution of the GULag
        system, a few hundred Greek-Catholic priests and monks were released from
        the camps and permitted to return to Western Ukraine.\n\nAmong those released
        were two bishops: Mykola Charnetsky, who returned to Lviv, and Ivan Liatyshevsky,
        the auxiliary bishop of the Stanislaviv Eparchy, who returned to Stanislaviv
        (today Ivano-Frankivsk). Although they were forbidden to engage in pastoral
        activities, both bishops continued to fulfill their episcopal obligations
        and ordained a number of priests. Due to the fact that many Ukrainian Greek-Catholic
        priests \u2013 now formally serving as Orthodox priests \u2013 appealed to
        the bishops by requesting absolution and their re-acceptance into the Greek-Catholic
        faith, in 1956 Bishop Charnetsky came to the conclusion that the priests should
        continue to provide pastoral care to the faithful in the Orthodox Church,
        while secretly belonging to the Greek-Catholic Church. Thus, the banned Greek-Catholic
        Church \u2013 without any possibility of legally serving its faithful \u2013
        managed to formally maintain its presence in the Orthodox Church in the form
        of a \"clandestine\" Greek-Catholic clergy. Furthermore, the Greek-Catholic
        Church was able to supplement, to some degree, the ranks of its priesthood
        through the \"underground\" Greek-Catholic seminaries.\n\n==New tensions regarding
        the status of and policies towards the UGCC==\n\nDe-Stalinization, just like
        the transformation of the Greek-Catholic Church in Poland in 1956-1957, brought
        hope for yet another legalization of the Greek-Catholic Church in Western
        Ukraine. A large number of appeals regarding legalization were produced by
        the faithful, while a few parishes even rejected Orthodoxy. The publication
        in December 1957 of a resolution adopted in October of that year by the deans
        of the Lviv Eparchy during a conference held at the Pochaiv Monastery, quashed
        these aspirations. The resolution distinctly underscored the fact that the
        Soviet government''s stance regarding the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church
        had not changed and that it [the church] will continue to be interpreted as
        an instrument in the hands of \"enemies of the state.\"\n\nMoreover, a clear
        signal of the regime''s hard-line attitude towards the Greek-Catholic Church,
        was the arrest, in the spring of 1958, of exiled Metropolitan Josyf Slipyj
        under the premise of illegal contacts with members of the clergy and the smuggling
        abroad of the metropolitan''s pastoral letters and other correspondence. Following
        lengthy hearings in June 1959, during a closed trial in Kyiv, the metropolitan
        was sentenced to an additional 7 years of imprisonment.\n\nIt was only as
        a result of ongoing discussions between Pope John XXIII, Nikita Khrushchev
        and President John F. Kennedy between 1961 and 1963, that the metropolitan
        was finally released from imprisonment in late January 1963. On 4 February
        1963, after secretly appointing Vasyl Velychkovsky as bishop-exarch of Lviv,
        Slipyj departed Moscow en route to Rome. However, improved relations between
        the Vatican and Moscow did not benefit the status of the Greek-Catholic Church
        in Ukraine \u2013 repressions against active, underground Uniate bishops and
        clergy commenced once again.\n\nThe relative amelioration of Moscow-Vatican
        relations coincided with the final phase of Krushchev''s \"de-Stalinization\"
        period, which nevertheless consisted of an ongoing Soviet anti-religious policy,
        the main target of which, since the late 1950s, was the Russian Orthodox Church.
        Prior to Khrushchev''s ouster at the end of 1964, a large number of Orthodox
        churches, monasteries and seminaries were closed.\n\nSeeking to establish
        amicable relations with the Kremlin, the Moscow Patriarchate renewed its function
        as a supporter and defender of Soviet foreign policy. In 1960, the Russian
        Orthodox Church joined the World Council of Churches and initiated contact
        with the Vatican. The illegal status of the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church
        in the USSR became the key point of contention between the Vatican and the
        Moscow Patriarchate. In this respect, Moscow''s greatest wish was for the
        pope to renounce the Uniates. At a minimum, the task was to maintain the status
        quo and keep the Vatican from legalizing the Greek-Catholic Church worldwide.\n\nThe
        Moscow Patriarchate hoped that closer relations with the pope would neutralize
        the pressure induced by Uniate \u00e9migr\u00e9 circles upon the Vatican,
        as well as demoralize the underground church in Ukraine. In both cases, the
        Moscow Patriarchate achieved a certain amount of success during the papacy
        of Paul VI, which coincided with the leadership of Leonid Brezhnev.\n\n==The
        Brezhnev Period==\n\nPhoto: Monument of Metropolitan Josyf Slipyj in Ternopil\n\nThe
        Greek-Catholic clergy \u2013 undaunted by disciplinary sanctions in 1965-1966
        \u2013 in mid-1966 began celebrating liturgies on Sundays and religious holidays
        in officially non-functioning churches in Western Ukraine. The clergy''s actions
        served as a test to monitor the regime''s potential reaction to such activity.
        Thus, by August 1967, close to 200 churches were once again meeting the spiritual
        needs of Ukrainian Catholics in Galicia, while a large number of those priests
        who had been \"accepted\" into the Orthodox Church, were secretly seeking
        the opportunity to return to the Greek-Catholic Church.\n\nCountless appeals
        for the legal registration of Ukrainian Greek-Catholic parishes were rejected
        by the regime.\n\nDespite the regime''s warnings, the majority of the active
        clergy openly continued its pastoral activity. The restored legal status of
        the Greek-Catholic Church in neighboring Czechoslovakia in June 1968 (which
        was not rescinded following the Soviet invasion in August of that year) and
        the subsequent return of the majority of the parishes, which had been transferred
        in 1950 to the government-supported Orthodox Church, galvanized the Uniates
        in Galicia and inclined Cardinal Josyf Slipyj, that same year, to relay a
        memorandum to the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of Ukraine calling for the
        legalization of the Church. The meeting between the head of the Presidium
        of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, Mykola Pidhornyi and Pope Paul VI on June
        30, 1969, produced equally futile, as it were, aspirations for a swift breakthrough
        in Vatican-Soviet negotiations regarding the legalization of the Ukrainian
        Greek-Catholic Church.\n\nHowever, just as in 1957, prospects for the UGCC''s
        resurgence from the underground compelled the Russian Orthodox Church in 1968
        to demand from the Soviet regime an assurance that this would never happen.
        In October 1968, a new wave of repressions was initiated against the Ukrainian
        Greek-Catholic Church. The arrest of Bishop Velychkovsky and two underground
        priests was the culmination of this last crackdown on the cusp of 1968-1969.
        Empty churches throughout the countryside which at one time had been frequented
        by Greek Catholics, were now being either destroyed by the local authorities
        or utilized for various secular purposes; a number of churches were transformed
        into museums of atheism. In some locales the situation came to a head between
        the militia and faithful, including incidents of violence where the faithful
        were brutally beaten or temporarily detained by the militia. Moreover, priests
        who were caught celebrating liturgical services were issued monetary fines.\n\nThis
        renewed wave of repressions coincided with Moscow''s crackdown on political
        demonstrations in Ukraine which manifested themselves in the form of Ukrainian
        dissidents'' support for the renewal of the Greek-Catholic Church. The beginning
        of the 1970s was also characterized by a significant increase in defamatory
        and intimidating publications in the press.\n\nThese new attacks divided the
        Ukrainian Greek-Catholic clergy vis-\u00e0-vis the prospects for the legalization
        of their church. Many representatives of the clergy fell under the assumption
        that the regime will never recognize the Church and therefore a \"compromise\"
        \u2013 as was often proposed by KGB operatives during interrogations \u2013
        would serve as a possible solution. Others, on the other hand, sought some
        kind modus vivendi and hoped for some sort of Vatican-Moscow outcome which
        would benefit the status and further the recognition process of the Ukrainian
        Greek-Catholic Church.\n\nThroughout 1972-1973, Ukrainian Catholics submitted
        to the [Soviet] government many declarations calling for the legalization
        of the Church. However, fear of repressions hindered the collecting of signatures.
        A petition relayed to Moscow in February 1973 via a delegation headed by Rev.
        Volodymyr Prokopiv garnered 1200 signatures. The initiative spearheaded by
        Rev. Prokopiv \u2013 who attempted to secure the Church''s registration under
        the hope of a compromise \u2013 did not enjoy broad support amongst the clergy.
        Rev. Prokopiv''s proposal appeared to be yet another attempt to implode the
        Church from within.\n\nThe Final Act of the Conference on Security and Cooperation
        in Europe (OSCE) in Helsinki in August 1975 served as an important step towards
        the implementation of international monitoring of Human Rights in the USSR,
        particularly the freedom of religion. For the underground Ukrainian Greek-Catholic
        Church \u2013 the largest banned religious organization in the Soviet Union
        \u2013 the Helsinki Accords initiated the practice of regularly held observational
        conferences. In addition, the engagement of foreign, independent monitoring
        organizations as well as unofficial Helsinki Groups in the USSR (the Ukrainian
        Helsinki Group was formed in November 1976), paved the way for the internationalization
        of the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church. Beginning with the Belgrade conference
        in late 1977, the issue of the violation of the Ukrainian Greek-Catholics''
        religious freedom would now be formally raised on a constant basis. This took
        place directly or indirectly in the form of various presentations and documents
        issued by American, Canadian and Vatican delegations as well as by other Western
        powers, thus exerting considerable pressure on the Soviet government.\n\nIn
        late spring 1978, yet another initiative was undertaken \u2013 most likely
        under the impetus of the Soviet Ukrainian government \u2013 to resolve the
        legalization issue of the UGCC in the form of a \"Roman Catholic Church of
        the Eastern Rite.\" The initiative group drafted a statute of such a church
        and proposed that its head be a Roman Catholic bishop from Lithuania to be
        appointed by the Pope. In so doing, the clergy''s activities would be limited
        to celebrating liturgies and performing other religious ceremonial functions.
        Finances and the administering of parochial affairs would be fulfilled by
        lay parish councils, as guaranteed by Soviet legislation under the category
        \"religious beliefs.\"\n\nOn 5 June 1978, the draft statute was submitted
        to the Council for Religious Affairs in Moscow. The overall initiative, however,
        failed to receive further attention and development. Even if the authorities
        had chosen to provide a formal response, the uncertainty regarding the future
        course of the Vatican''s \"Ost-Politik\" could have possibly decided the endeavour''s
        ultimate fate. Following the death of Pope Paul VI on 6 August 1978, and the
        unexpected passing of the pontiff''s immediate successor on 29 September of
        that year, John Paul II became pope on 16 October 1978.\n\n==Pope John Paul
        II and tensions vis-\u00e0-vis the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church==\n\nPhoto:
        Pope John Paul II\n\nJohn Paul II''s ascension to the Holy See ushered in
        the Vatican''s policy of support for the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church.
        The Soviet authorities'' concerns regarding the new pope''s intentions were
        confirmed by the publication of a letter (dated 19 March 1979) addressed to
        Cardinal Josyf Slipyj regarding the Millennium of Ukraine''s Christianity,
        scheduled to be commemorated in 1988. In his letter, John Paul II underscored
        the importance of preserving the Union of Brest, by expressing his respect
        for the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic episcopate, clergy, and faithful who bore
        witness to injustice and persecution in the name of Christ and professed their
        faith in God and their Church. Simultaneously directing his address at the
        Soviet government, the pope invoked the Universal Declaration of Human Rights
        by appealing to the authorities to allow each believer to profess his/her
        own faith and to participate in the communal life of the Church to which he/she
        belongs.\n\nThe pope''s letter to Slipyj not only sent shock waves and anxiety
        throughout the Vatican''s Secretariat for Promoting Christian Unity (headed
        at that time by Cardinal Johannes Willebrands), but also spurred a harsh reaction
        from Moscow. As a result, the Moscow Patriarchate immediately postponed a
        scheduled theological meeting with Roman Catholic hierarchs in Odesa. In addition,
        on 4 September 1979, the patriarchate''s representative in charge of external
        ecclesiastical affairs, Metropolitan Yuvenaliy, wrote a letter to Cardinal
        Willebrands in which he threatened the latter with \"public criticism,\" if
        Willebrands did not immediately explain the \"exact meaning\" behind the papal
        missive to Slipyj.\n\nUnsatisfied with Willebrands''s diplomatic response,
        Moscow once again expressed outrage when in March 1980 John Paul II convened
        an extraordinary synod of all the Ukrainian bishops. It was during this synod
        that the pope confirmed the selection of Archbishop Myroslav Ivan Lubachivsky
        as coadjutor \u2013 with the right of succession \u2013 to Archbishop of Lviv,
        Josyf Slipyj, thereby guaranteeing the continuity of the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic
        Metropolitanate''s leadership in Galicia. The already strained relations between
        Moscow and the Vatican were exacerbated even further, when later that same
        year the synod of Ukrainian bishops was once again summoned to Rome where,
        on 2 December 1980, it adopted a resolution which unanimously declared the
        Lviv Sobor of 1946 as uncanonical and void.\n\nThe Russian patriarch''s protest
        initiated a broad discussion within the Roman curia regarding the priorities
        of Vatican-Moscow political and ecumenical relations, and the effect of Moscow''s
        dissatisfaction with the Roman Catholic Church''s position in the Soviet bloc.
        The pope''s response to Moscow was issued on 24 January 1981, and was considered
        a compromise, which could satisfy neither the Russian Patriarchate nor the
        Ukrainian Greek-Catholics: the Apostolic See \u2013 by expressing its unwavering
        position in support of the rights of the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church \u2013
        nevertheless wanted the resolution (of the 1946 Sobor) to initially be disseminated
        throughout the press and for the documents to be accessible for review. As
        a result, Rome immediately informed all of the papal nuncios in those countries
        where Ukrainian Catholics dwelled that the texts of the resolution did not
        receive formal approval and were therefore not considered official documents.\n\nIn
        the spring of 1980, the Soviet press left no doubt that John Paul II was perceived
        as a serious threat. As a result, an anti-papal and anti-Uniate campaign was
        initiated, which in Ukraine was spearheaded by Leonid Kravchuk. He informed
        a conference of Orthodox bishops that authorities in Ukraine had embarked
        on a massive propaganda initiative and had taken certain administrative steps
        to counteract the \"nationalist and religious subversive deeds\" supported
        by the Vatican.\n\n==The Period of Transition==\n\nThe final years of the
        Brezhnev regime and the transitional rule of Yuri Andropov and Kostyantin
        Chernenko were characterized in terms of an increase in political control.
        This included attacks against any manifestation of ideological deviation as
        well as an escalation of propaganda against such influences from abroad as:
        nationalism, Catholicism, religious fundamentalism, Zionism and American imperialism.
        At a time when a \"patriotic\" rapprochement between the Kremlin and the Russian
        Orthodox Church was becoming more and more evident, the banned Ukrainian Greek-Catholic
        Church was subjected to yet another wave of repressions. During the first
        half of 1980, three Uniate priests were murdered, while in early 1981 three
        additional priests were imprisoned. At this same time, Soviet Secret Service
        officials began using new, advanced methods of infiltration and internal manipulation
        with the intent of destabilizing the underground Church and undermining its
        status abroad.\n\nFurthermore, during the early 1980s, several priests and
        proactive lay youth groups situated outside Ukraine took the initiative to
        distribute information worldwide about the dramatic situation of the Uniates
        and their struggle for the legalization of their Church. Domestically, in
        September 1982, under the leadership of Iosyp Terelia, \"The Initiative Group
        for the Defence of the Rights of Believers and the Church\" was organized.
        Following Terelia''s arrest and sentencing to a one-year term of incarceration
        in December 1982, the group''s leadership was assumed by another lay activist,
        Vasyl Kobryn, who in turn was arrested and sentenced to a three-year term
        of hard labour in November 1984. Beginning in 1984, on an irregular basis,
        the group began issuing a bulletin titled \"The Chronicle of the Catholic
        Church in Ukraine,\" edited for the most part Iosyp Terelia.\n\nIn addition
        to the overall grim situation surrounding the movement for the legalization
        of the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church, one of the reasons behind the publication
        of the bulletin had to do with the fact that the underground Church was facing
        an ever-deepening crisis. The source of this crisis was a clergy consisting
        of a majority of elderly and dying priests, who were trained under \"normal\"
        circumstances (prior to the Church''s destruction), and whose quantity could
        not be replaced by equally well-trained young clergymen. Another factor to
        contend with was the phenomenon of so-called \"crypto-Catholics\" who had
        evolved and increased in size over the course of the previous four decades
        by attending Orthodox services. Among them now functioned a new generation
        of Orthodox priests who had not undergone formation in the Uniate tradition
        and were thus increasingly distancing themselves from the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic
        Church. Given such circumstances, the concern was that this new generation
        of clergymen might not return to their original Church as long as it remained
        underground and was not officially recognized by the regime.\n\nCardinal Josyf
        Slipyj died on 7 September 1984 in Rome. He was succeeded, as planned, by
        Archbishop Myroslav Lubachivsky, whom Pope John Paul II appointed cardinal
        on 25 May 1985.\n\n==The status of the UGCC at the outset of the Gorbachev
        era==\n\nMikhail Gorbachev''s ascension to the leadership of the Communist
        Party and the introduction of \"Perestroika\" paved the way for a number of
        political concessions. In 1986-1987 almost all Ukrainian prisoners of conscience
        were released. Their freedom became the basis for a revitalized movement in
        support of human, national and religious rights in Ukraine.\n\nAs the fear
        of massive political repressions began to wane, the underground Church was
        becoming more assertive and visible. In the wake of Gorbachev''s reforms,
        \"The Initiative Group for the Defense of the Rights of Believers and the
        Church\" renewed its activities. In late 1987 \u2013 following Iosyp Terelia''s
        relocation to Canada \u2013 the Initiative Group''s title was changed to the
        \"Committee for the Defense of the Ukrainian Catholic Church\" and its leadership
        was now assumed by the recently released political dissident [[Ivan Gel]].\n\nThe
        Committee began to publish an uncensored journal titled \"The Christian Voice,\"
        which replaced \"The Chronicle.\" With the arrival of \"Glasnost,\" Ukrainian
        Catholic activists organized a campaign for the return of the Church''s pre-war
        status. As a result, the clergy began to celebrate liturgies in public for
        large congregations of Greek-Catholics, particularly at pilgrimage sites.
        In addition, activists began organizing petitions demanding the reopening
        of Greek-Catholic churches as well as the full rehabilitation and legalization
        of the Church. Furthermore, the faithful were being encouraged to publicly
        confront the authorities on the issue of the constitutional rights of Ukrainian
        Catholics'' religious freedom. Through the intervention of non-Ukrainian dissident
        movements in the Soviet Union, the Committee also began to distribute to the
        Western media not only various printed as well as audio-visual materials attesting
        to the massive support for the renewal of the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church,
        but also evidence of the ongoing repressions by Soviet authorities.\n\nIn
        early August 1987, a group consisting of Ukrainian Greek-Catholic priests,
        monks and lay people, including bishops [[Pavlo Vasylyk]] and [[Ivan Semedi]],
        announced that it is \"leaving the underground,\" and called upon the pope
        to \"support the legalization of the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church in the
        USSR in every possible way.\" Soon afterwards, additional Ukrainian Catholic
        bishops, namely Metropolitan [[Volodymyr Sterniuk]] of Lviv and bishop [[Sofron
        Dmyterko]] of Ivano-Frankivsk, joined the group of activists demanding legalization.
        Pope [[John Paul II]] was now, on many an occasion, taking up the plight of
        Ukrainian Catholics in the USSR, and high expectations were being held in
        regards to the upcoming commemoration of the Millennium of Ukrainian Christianity.\n\nThe
        Pope celebrated the Millennium together with the hierarchs of the Ukrainian
        Greek-Catholic Church in Rome in 1988, subject to the condition that he could
        make a pastoral visit to a Ukrainian Greek-Catholic church, to serve as a
        symbolic gesture of gratitude to the pontiff for approving a high-ranking
        delegation''s participation in Millennium festivities in Moscow and Kyiv.
        This led to a planned meeting in Moscow scheduled for 10 June 1988 between
        cardinals Agostino Casaroli and Johannes Willebrands and a Ukrainian Greek-Catholic
        Church delegation headed by bishops [[Fylymon Kurchaba]] and [[Pavlo Vasylyk]].\n\nOn
        17 September 1988, bishop [[Pavlo Vasylyk]] was invited to Moscow to take
        part in a roundtable discussion regarding the UGCC''s situation in the Soviet
        Union. Additional discussants at the meeting also included four US senators
        and members of the USSR''s Supreme Soviet (Parliament).\n\nNevertheless, Soviet
        authorities in Moscow and Ukraine, who consistently denied the UGCC''s existence,
        rejected the latest initiatives for the Church''s legalization. The Soviet
        press secretary argued that legalization is an internal matter of the Russian
        Orthodox Church, which itself is against any changes to the status quo in
        Western Ukraine. Furthermore, the authorities declared that the Ukrainian
        Greek-Catholic Church is not a religious organization but rather a \"strictly
        political,\" \"nationalist,\" and \"separatist\" entity and therefore does
        not qualify for registration as a religious denomination. In addition, the
        Uniate Church continued to be viewed as a supporter of nationalist leaders
        in Ukraine and abroad.\n\nThe Russian Orthodox Church \u2013 whose official
        status began to improve considerably starting in 1987 \u2013 was now beginning
        to voice its protest, both domestically and abroad, against the possible repeal
        of the Stalinist-era prohibition officially forbidding activities of the Ukrainian
        Greek-Catholic Church. In addition, Russian church hierarchs were displeased
        with the ever-increasing threat by the Uniate eparchies and parishes in Galicia
        and Transcarpathia to leave the Moscow Patriarchate to which they had been
        forcibly annexed.\n\nIn the summer of 1988, the authorities initiated new
        repressive measures regarding \"unsanctioned\" public gatherings and demonstrations.
        Such actions, taken against the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic clergy and lay people,
        included substantial monetary fines and administrative penalties in the form
        short-term arrests. At the end of 1988, Soviet authorities reacted to the
        now continuous efforts for the legalization of the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic
        Church by transferring more than 700 soon-to-be-reopened provincial Uniate
        churches to hastily organized Orthodox so-called \"Twentiers\" (Ukr. dvadtsiatky)
        primarily in locations where Greek-Catholics constituted a majority. According
        to a Soviet ordinance of that time, 20 religious faithful constituted a sufficient
        number of believers to secure registration as a religious community.\n\nOn
        7 February 1989, a UGCC delegation headed by bishop [[Pavlo Vasylyk]] departed
        for Moscow to engage in negotiations at which it demanded the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic
        Church''s recognition by the USSR''s central authorities.\n\nExpectations
        were high that the new legislation on the freedom of conscience, which was
        about to go into effect, would help pave the way for the legalization of the
        Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church. However, in May 1989, Kyivan Metropolitan
        Filaret''s actions at that time hindered such possibilities. During a press
        conference in Lviv \u2013 in the presence of the head of the Council for Religious
        Affairs in Ukraine (M. Kolesnyk) \u2013 the metropolitan announced that the
        new law did \"not legitimize\" the Uniates. Furthermore, the Orthodox hierarch
        suggested that Ukrainian Greek-Catholics should attend services at functioning
        Roman Catholic churches, while those who felt a close affinity to the Eastern
        Byzantine Rite should attend Orthodox churches. Finally, Metropolitan Filaret
        remarked that the legalization of the Uniate Church could provoke clashes
        between the Orthodox and Greek-Catholics.\n\n==Intensification for the legalization
        of the UGCC==\n\nPhoto: St. George''s Cathedral in Lviv\n\nIn response to
        Metropolitan Filaret''s assertion that the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church
        will never attain legal status, on 16 May 1989, 4 bishops and 10 priests of
        the UGCC submitted a formal appeal to General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev.
        In their declaration, the church officials refuted 160 political accusations
        aimed at the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church, voiced their support for Gorbachev''s
        reforms and demanded the legalization of the UGCC.\n\nThus, on 16 May 1989,
        prior to the congress of USSR deputies, another delegation arrived in Moscow
        composed of bishops Pavlo Vasylyk, Sofron Dmyterko, Fylymon Kurchaba and Rev.
        H. Simkailo, Rev. V. Viytyshyn (currently archbishop of Ivano-Frankivsk),
        Rev. T. Senkiw (at present the apostolic administrator of the Stryi Eparchy)
        and Rev. Ihor Vozniak (currently archbishop of Lviv), as well as a number
        of religious faithful to meet with the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of
        the USSR.\n\nOn 17 May, after government officials did not appear for a scheduled
        meeting with the delegation, the UGCC bishops and priests began a hunger strike
        which caught the attention of the international broadcasting media and also
        appeared on the first pages of the press. On 18 May, the delegation was met
        by a representative of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR who
        received another formal appeal intended for Mikhail Gorbachev. Following the
        delegation''s departure from Moscow, various groups of Ukrainian Greek-Catholics
        took turns participating in hunger strikes over the course of the next 4 months
        in Moscow. Such hunger strikes occurred simultaneously with public prayer
        services and efforts to entice the Ukrainian delegates of the congress of
        people''s deputies of the USSR, 4 of which, unsuccessfully, attempted to raise
        the issue of the legalization of the UGCC during the congress''s sessions.
        The Moscow activities of the Ukrainian Greek-Catholics received not only the
        recognition of the international community but also the support of Russian
        Orthodox dissidents and various democratic circles. However, the hunger strikers''
        most significant achievement occurred when the reforms-oriented newspaper
        Moskovskie Novosti (Moscow News) began to publish objective and favorable
        reports on the ongoing events. For the first time ever, the newspaper raised
        doubts about the official Soviet version regarding the \"unification of the
        Uniates\" and accused the Russian Orthodox Church of condoning the repressive
        Stalinist methods being used against supporters of the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic
        Church.\n\nThe legalization of the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church posed a
        serious threat to the status of the Russian Orthodox Church in Western Ukraine.
        As a result, the Moscow Patriarchate and Volodymyr Scherbytsky''s party apparatchiks
        took decisive measures to prevent legalization. In May\u2013June 1989, the
        question of the Uniate Church caused a schism amongst the ranks of Soviet
        politicians, which in turn delayed the legislative passage of the long-awaited
        \"Law on the Freedom of Conscience.\" Furthermore, the issue of the UGCC also
        led to the replacement of K. Kharchev by Y. Khrystoradnov as head of the Council
        for Religious Affairs of the USSR. In addition, Y. Kashliev, as head of the
        delegation at the Vienna conference, stated that every religious denomination
        has the right to be registered. The discussion surrounding the UGCC \u2013
        which hitherto was considered an internal issue of the Russian Orthodox Church
        \u2013 now became the responsibility of the state. Kashliev also underscored
        the fact that the Uniate question should be settled as quickly as possible.\n\nA
        key event which had the potential to weaken opposition to the legalization
        of the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church occurred on 17 September 1989, when,
        according to official accounts, close to 100,000 UGCC supporters took part
        in an unprecedented demonstration in Lviv. Large demonstrations began to take
        place in other cities of Western Ukraine at this time as well. The movement
        for legalization, headed by Ivan Hel, was now being augmented by the Ukrainian
        urban intelligentsia which began organizing itself into various informal associations,
        including The Popular Movement of Ukraine for Restructuring (Rukh).\n\nOn
        20 September 1989, Scherbytsky and Viktor Chebrykov were ousted from the Politburo
        of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. One week
        later (28 September) Volodymyr Ivashko replaced Shcerbytsky as 1st Secretary
        of the Communist Party of Ukraine. As a result, those officials in favor of
        a more conservative line regarding the UGCC were no longer in the top positions
        of the Ukrainian Communist Party. The plenary session of the Central Committee
        of the Communist Party of Ukraine (18 October 1989) reflected the Central
        Committee''s deepening indecisiveness regarding the future status of the Ukrainian
        Greek-Catholic Church.\n\nOn the heels of the increasingly tense atmosphere,
        the parish of Sts. Peter and Paul of the Russian Orthodox Church in Lviv had
        announced its allegiance to the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church (UAOC)
        on 19 August 1989. Two additional Lviv parishes soon followed suit and subsequently
        the same steps were taken by a few hundred parishes throughout Galicia. At
        first, the authorities placed administrative sanctions on the parishes but
        then cancelled such directives hoping to avoid confrontations with parishioners
        and the local RUKH affiliates, which had already managed to spread their influence
        on the UAOC. It cannot be ruled out that Soviet authorities considered the
        supporters of the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church as the \"lesser
        of two evils\" when taking into account the Uniates. It is quite possible
        that Soviet government officials were hoping for an open conflict between
        the Uniates and supporters of Ukrainian Autocephaly which in turn would cause
        a division within the Ukrainian national movement.\n\nOn 22 October 1989,
        bishop Ivan Bodnarchuk of the Russian Orthodox Church (a native Galician)
        \u2013 who had very recently relinquished his episcopal duties in Zhytomyr
        \u2013 had accepted leadership of the Autocephalous Church in Ukraine.\n\nOn
        29 October, Ukrainian Greek-Catholics under the guidance of a young priest,
        Fr. Yaroslav Chukhniy, peacefully took over one of the largest ecclesiastical
        structures in Lviv, namely the Church of the Transfiguration of Our Lord.
        Until the transfer of St. George''s Cathedral to the faithful of the UGCC
        in August 1990, the parish of the Transfiguration served as the spiritual
        centre of Ukrainian Greek-Catholicism in Galicia.\n\nOn 26 November \u2013
        one week prior to Gorbachev''s meeting with Pope John Paul II in Rome \u2013
        over 100,000 UGCC faithful took part in a demonstration demanding the return
        of St. George''s Cathedral to the Ukrainian Greek-Catholics.\n\n==Partial
        recognition of the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church==\n\nThe Apostolic See
        consistently raised the issue of the rights of Ukrainian Greek-Catholics during
        its numerous negotiations with the Kremlin \u2013 despite minimal reciprocity
        \u2013 ever since Soviet-Vatican relations experienced a thaw beginning in
        the early 1960s. In June 1988, the Vatican once again expressed its desire
        for the UGCC''s legalization when a delegation to Moscow headed by Cardinals
        Casaroli and Willebrands took part in the festivities commemorating the Millennium
        of the Baptism of Kyivan Rus''.\n\nGorbachev replied to the pope''s proposal
        only in August 1989. Official correspondence had been established between
        the Kremlin and the Moscow Patriarchate on one side and the Apostolic See
        on the other side. Gorbachev maintained that it was both the Vatican''s and
        the Moscow Patriarchate''s obligation to reach a consensus regarding the Ukrainian
        Greek-Catholic question. Shortly afterwards, in a letter addressed to Pope
        John Paul II on 16 August 1989, Patriarch Pimen put forth a proposal which
        was unacceptable to the Vatican. In his missive, the Russian Orthodox hierarch
        recommended the de facto liquidation of the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church
        by way of adjoining the Uniates who place the Eastern Rite above Catholic
        dogma \u2013 to the Orthodox Church, and those Uniates who favor Catholicism
        \u2013 to the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nMoscow based its strategy on the hope
        of benefiting from the disparity within the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church
        in the form of its \"Eastern\" and \"Roman\" orientations. Furthermore, the
        Russian Orthodox Church banked on taking advantage of the decades-long discord
        between the Vatican and the UGCC''s \u00e9migr\u00e9 activists who were demanding
        the appointment of a separate patriarch for Ukrainian Greek-Catholics outside
        Ukraine. A potential settlement in the form of a compromise had been discussed
        when Archbishop Angelo Sodano (the Vatican''s Secretary of State) visited
        Moscow on 19\u201321 October 1989, and met with M. Gorbachev, Soviet Foreign
        Affairs Minister Eduard Shevarnadze, and the head of the Council for Religious
        Affairs, Y. Khrystoradnov. As a result of the meeting, the Vatican was assured
        that the new law on the freedom of conscience and religious organizations
        in essence will legalize the UGCC. Nevertheless, the Soviet authorities insisted
        that specific aspects of the legalization process be coordinated between the
        Vatican, the Kremlin and the Moscow Patriarchate based on the principles of
        genuine ecumenical dialogue between the Roman Catholic and Russian Orthodox
        Churches.\n\nThe pope''s expectations for the legalization of the UGCC in
        the Soviet Union were once again put forward in his response to Patriarch
        Pimen''s August letter which in turn was presented to the Holy Synod on 1
        November 1989, by Cardinal Willebrands and his successor as head of the Pontifical
        Council for Promoting Christian Unity, Cardinal Edward Cassidy. The Moscow
        Partriarchate had agreed only on the legal right of Ukrainian Greek-Catholics
        to practice their faith. The issue of permitting the UGCC clergy to obtain
        actual pastoral appointments, and other unresolved questions were to be set
        aside for future negotiations between the Vatican and the Moscow Patriarchate.
        This position was presented to the Pope in the form of a letter from Patriarch
        Pimen, delivered to Rome by Metropolitan Yuvenaliy on 27 November.\n\nMikhail
        Gorbachev''s meeting with Pope John Paul II on 1 December 1989, marked a rapprochement
        between the Vatican and the Kremlin. The Roman Pontiff once again expressed
        his will for Roman Catholics and Greek-Catholics to have the possibility of
        freely practicing their faith, while Gorbachev assured John Paul II that the
        future law on freedom of conscience would provide religious freedom to everyone
        in the USSR. The meeting laid the foundation for establishing bilateral diplomatic
        relations, and the pope accepted Gorbachev''s invitation to visit the Soviet
        Union. Realizing that the outright legalization of the Uniate Church would
        cause religious unrest in Western Ukraine and would lead to conflict with
        the Moscow Patriarchate, Gorbachev refused to delegate direct responsibility
        to the government regarding the settlement of the UGCC question. Instead,
        the Soviet leader decided that these issues should be settled according to
        the principles of ecumenical dialogue between the Moscow Patriarchate and
        the Vatican.\n\nOn 1 December 1989, the Soviet news agency  Novosti (News)
        and news services in Western Ukraine outlined the key points of \"The Declaration
        of the Council for Religious Affairs Addressed to the Council of Ministers
        of the Ukrainian S.S.R.,\" dated 20 November. The Lviv municipal press labeled
        the \"Declaration\" a de facto recognition of the long-banned Ukrainian Greek-Catholic
        Church. At the same time though, the Declaration asserted that Ukrainian Greek-Catholics
        will be able to enjoy all the rights guaranteed by the law on registration
        of associations in the Ukrainian S.S.R., as long as they [the UGCC faithful]
        uphold the principles of the Constitution of the Ukrainian S.S.R. and the
        latter''s legislation on religious beliefs. All religious structures arbitrarily
        appropriated by the UGCC faithful were to be returned to local administrative
        authorities. The transfer of such property to religious communities would
        take place according to the will of the faithful themselves. If necessary,
        the \"Declaration\" called for holding local referendums to be monitored by
        independent observers, and cautioned against undue influence on the faithful,
        to guarantee an objective and unbiased vote.\n\nAt the same time, the head
        of the Council for Religious Affairs of the Ukrainian S.S.R., M. P. Kolesnyk,
        underscored that the council had not considered the canonical status of the
        infrastructure and hierarchies of the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church. Instead,
        it had only taken into account the rights of a \"community of believers\"
        to apply for state registration (recognition) and the possibility for the
        denationalization (privatization) of inactive church structures. Furthermore,
        there was no talk of returning ecclesiastical structures and property \u2013
        nationalized by the state \u2013 to the UGCC, nor of annulling the Lviv pseudo-Sobor
        of 1946, nor of a formal rehabilitation of the Church or even any kind of
        compensation for losses incurred over the decades.\n\nIn response to the promise
        for legalization, the Ukrainian Greek-Catholics reappropriated their former
        churches from the Russian Orthodox Church. By January 1990, over 120 churches
        in Galicia had been returned to the UGCC. By the end of the month, this number
        had increased to 230 churches on the territory of the Lviv and Ternopil eparchies,
        and to 140 on the territory of the Ivano-Frankivsk eparchy.\n\nBy June 1990,
        803 churches had been returned to the Ukrainian Greek-Catholics in newly established
        (albeit for the most part unregistered) Uniate parishes in the Lviv eparchy,
        including approximately 500 churches in the Ivano-Frankivsk eparchy and 12
        in Transcarpathia. Close to 370 Orthodox priests had converted to the UGCC
        in Galicia. This increased the overall quantity of Greek-Catholic priests
        to 767 (including 186 monks). In general, 1,592 Greek-Catholic parishes had
        been established and 1,303 churches were taken over in Galicia by early summer
        1990. In addition, newly established seminaries accepted 485 students, while
        approximately 700 nuns were active in the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church
        throughout Western Ukraine. At the same time, close to 500 Orthodox parishes
        converted to the UAOC.\n\nThe massive reappropriation by the Ukrainian Greek-Catholics
        of their former churches spurred a wave of protests on the part of the Moscow
        Patriarchate. Supporters of the Russian Orthodox Church accused the Uniates
        of illegally taking over churches, threatening the Orthodox faithful and persecuting
        the clergy.\n\nThe change in the party and governmental leadership of the
        Ukrainian S.S.R. impacted the Russian Orthodox Church as well. In 1989, the
        leadership of the exarchate found it necessary to make a number of concessions
        regarding the Ukrainian language. In January 1990, the Ukrainian Exarchate
        of the Russian Orthodox Church was retitled the Ukrainian Orthodox Church.
        Shortly after June 1990, the Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church expressed
        its concern regarding the liquidation of its Church for the benefit of the
        Uniates and the autocephalous \"schismatics\" in Western Ukraine. As a result,
        a special commission of the Holy Synod visited Ukraine, headed by the newly
        appointed Moscow Patriarch, Aleksei II.\n\nIn response to the Declaration
        of the State Sovereignty of Ukraine on 16 July 1990, in October the Russian
        Orthodox Church bestowed the right for \"self-government\" to the Ukrainian
        Orthodox Church, which, nevertheless, was to remain an integral component
        of the Moscow Patriarchate. The creation of the UAOC \u2013 although limited
        at that time to the territory of Galicia \u2013 posed a much greater, long-term
        threat to the ROC than the revival of the UGCC, because the autocephalous
        church boasted supporters in traditional Orthodox territories of Eastern Ukraine.\n\nOn
        19 August 1990, the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church received possession of
        the historic Cathedral of St. George in Lviv. In September 1990, 250 students
        began their studies at the archeparchial seminary in Rudno, while 47 seminarians
        initiated their studies at the seminary in Drohobych. In addition, approximately
        300 students were attending improvised lectures on theology in Ivano-Frankivsk.
        Similarly, the Basilians opened a minor seminary for 70 students and a novitiate
        at their monastery in Krekhiv.\n\nIn a state of increasing tension between
        the Orthodox and Ukrainian Greek-Catholics, a Vatican delegation once again
        met with its counterparts from the Moscow Patriarchate on 10 September 1990,
        in Moscow. These delegations, in turn, were soon joined by three Ukrainian
        Greek-Catholic bishops and their Orthodox counterparts. However, on 14 September,
        the Russian Orthodox delegates exited the negotiations after the Ukrainian
        Greek-Catholic delegation unanimously rejected the demands of the Orthodox
        to return the reappropriated Uniate churches in Lviv and Ivano-Frankivsk.
        Soon afterwards, the trilateral, inter-denominational Lviv regional commission
        fell apart when representatives of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church and Ukrainian
        Autocephalous Orthodox Church resigned their positions in the negotiating
        body after accusing the local authorities of favoring the UGCC in the settlement
        of church property ownership.\n\nIn the fall of 1990, the head of the Ukrainian
        Greek-Catholic Church, Cardinal Myroslav Lubachivsky, declared his intention
        to visit the faithful in Ukraine in the spring of 1991.\n\n==See also==\n*

        (24 August 2016)</ref>\n\n==History==\nPrior to the [[October Revolution]]
        of 1917, three separate self-governing Ukrainian states existed on what is
        Ukraine today. Each of these states possessed armed forces. The largest of
        these, the [[Ukrainian People''s Republic]], itself comprised three separate
        regimes. The [[Ukrainian People''s Army]] is an example of one of the early
        national armed forces. Other armed independence movements existed in the wake
        of both the [[First World War]] and the [[Second World War]], and these armies
        each had distinct organisation and uniforms. These armed forces, and the independent
        Ukrainian homeland for which they fought, were eventually incorporated into
        the neighboring states of [[Poland]], [[Soviet Union]], [[Hungary]], [[Romania]]
        and [[Czechoslovakia]].<ref>Abbott, P. & E. Pinak ''''Ukrainian Armies 1914\u201355''''
        (Osprey Publishing Ltd., 2004), {{ISBN|1780964013}}, 9781780964010</ref>\n\n===Collapse
        of the USSR===\nThe Armed Forces of Ukraine included approximately 780,000
        personnel, 7,000 [[armored vehicles]], 6,500 tanks, and 2,500 [[tactical nuclear
        missile]]s when they were established. However, the problem that Ukraine face
        was that while it had vast armed forces, it lacked a proper command structure.
        Therefore, on 24 August 1991, the [[Verkhovna Rada]] of [[Ukraine]] ratified
        the resolution of taking under its control, all military units of former Soviet
        Armed Forces, situated on the territory of Ukraine; and in turn the establishment
        of the [[Ministry of Defence of Ukraine]].\n\n===Creation of the Ground Forces===\n{{Ukrainian
        Armed forces}}\nFollowing the declaration of Ukrainian independence in 1991,
        Ukraine inherited the [[1st Guards Army (Soviet Union)|1st Guards Army]],
        [[13th Army (Soviet Union)|13th Army]], [[38th Army (Soviet Union)|38th Army]],
        two tank armies (the [[6th Guards Tank Army]] and the 8th Tank Army), and
        the [[32nd Army Corps]] (32-\u0439 \u041a\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0433\u0441\u0431\u0435\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439

        at [[Simferopol]]. In addition, the [[28th Guards Mechanised Brigade|28th
        Guards Motor Rifle Division]] (MRD) and the 180th MRD were left in Ukraine,
        having been previously under the [[14th Guards Army]] headquartered at [[Tiraspol]]
        in the [[Moldovan SSR]]. The post of commander of ground troops was designated
        in early 1992. By the end of 1992, the [[Kiev Military District]] disbanded,
        and Ukraine used its structures as the basis for the Ministry of Defence and
        the [[General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces|General Staff]].<ref>[http://www.ukrweekly.com/Archive/1997/099704.shtml

        to have taken place.<ref>See references at [[6th Guards Tank Army]] and [[6th
        Army Corps (Ukraine)]]. On 1 December 1993, 8th Guards Tank Army became 8th
        Army Corps.</ref> While the chief of ground forces post had been created in
        early 1992, it was over two years before the first holder, Colonel General
        [[Vasily Sobkov]], was appointed on 7 April 1994.<ref>Jane''s Sentinel: Ukraine,
        1994</ref> The legal framework for the Ground Forces was defined in Article
        4 of the law ''On the Armed Forces of Ukraine.'' At that time, the Ground
        Forces had no separate command body, and were directly subordinate to the
        Ukrainian General Staff.\n\nThe creation of the Ground Forces as a separate
        armed service was legally only put in train by Presidential Decree 368/96
        of 23 May 1996, ''On the Ground Forces of Ukraine.''<ref>Yuriy Yurchnya, ''The
        Armed Forces of Ukraine,'' DCAF, 2010, 89.</ref>\nThat year both the Ground
        Forces Command was formed and the 1st Army Corps was reorganised as the Northern
        Territorial Operational Command (which became the Northern Operational Command
        in 1998). In 1997 the Carpathian Military District was reorganised as the
        [[Western Operational Command]].\n\nFrom 1992 to 1997, the forces of the Kiev
        MD were transferred to the Odessa MD, and the Odessa MD''s headquarters moved
        to [[Donetsk]].<ref>Andrew Duncan, ''Ukraine''s forces find that change is
        good,'' [[Jane''s Intelligence Review]], April 1997, 162\u20133.</ref> A new
        2nd Army Corps was formed in the Odessa MD. Armies were converted to army
        corps, and motor rifle divisions converted into mechanised divisions or brigades.
        Pairs of attack helicopter regiments were combined to form army aviation brigades.\n\nPresident
        [[Leonid Kuchma]] revealed in a December 1996 speech that as many as 191 mechanised
        infantry and tank battalions were rated not ready, adding,\"This is especially
        dangerous in the forward-based units securing the nation''s borders.\"<ref>Stephen

        to a plan promulgated in 2000 the Ground Forces were to reduce the number
        of troops from the then 300,000 to 240,000 by 2015, and an ultimate change
        from a partial [[conscript]]-based force to a fully professional military.<ref>http://merln.ndu.edu/whitepapers/Ukraine_Eng-2005.pdf

        half of the [[Ukrainian hryvnia|Hr]] 68 million it was promised for reform
        in 2001, officials were able to disband nine [[regiment]]s and close 21 local
        military bases.{{#tag:ref|According to the State Program of the Ukrainian
        Armed Forces reform and development to 2005, the ground forces were to have
        the biggest ratio of personnel of all services (up to 54%). This ratio was
        to be based on the missions assigned to the armed forces, and also on the
        fact that the [[economy of Ukraine]] could not support any larger troop numbers.
        However, the ground forces still has priority in the number of personnel,
        weapons, military equipment development priorities and the development of
        their future systems, which were to correspond to [[modern warfare]] requirements.
        The ground forces were planned to closely coordinate their assignments with
        other army branches, engaging appropriate military arts and equipment. They
        were to also be involved in law enforcement activities during emergencies,
        dealing with consequences of technological and [[natural disasters]], providing
        military assistance to other countries, engaging in international military

        contingent of troops to the [[Iraq War]], these were stationed near [[Kut]].
        Ukraine''s troop deployment was the second largest of all former Soviet states
        besides [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and they deployed more soldiers to the
        nation then many members of [[NATO]] such as Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania.
        Ukraine also suffered the fifth highest casualty toll during the war, with
        only Polish, Italian, UK, and US forces suffering heavier losses.<ref>{{cite

        withdraws last troops from Iraq|publisher=Reliefweb|date=2005-12-05}}</ref>\n\nFrom
        2003-2005 over 1,700 Ukrainian soldiers were deployed to Iraq, the third largest
        contingent at the time, they were designated to the [[5th Mechanized Brigade
        (Ukraine)]], as in Ukraine''s mission to Kosovo the troops deployed were contract
        soldiers and not conscripts. Ukraine began to severely draw down its troop
        levels in Iraq in 2005 due to mounting casualties and the political toxicity
        of the conflict. By 2005 only 876 soldiers, roughly half of the original contingent
        were deployed, by years end troop levels dropped to below 100. In 2008, one
        year before the official end of the US military mission President Viktor Yushchenko
        ordered all remaining troops deployed to Iraq returned home and Ukraine''s
        mission to the nation officially over.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.army.mil/article/15056/ukrainians-complete-mission-in-iraq/|title=Ukrainians

        2001 Ukraine allowed United States military cargo planes to fly over and refuel
        on Ukrainian soil on their way to Afghanistan. In 2007 Ukraine deployed  a
        detachment of the 143rd De-mining Center of the [[Armed Forces of Ukraine]]
        to Afghanistan. Ukraine has kept a team of soldiers deployed to Afghanistan
        as part of ISAF since 2007, these mostly consisted of pilots, medical officers,
        and bomb disposal experts. Ukrainian pilots were responsible for training
        the pilots of the Afghan Air Force on the operation of several air craft as
        Afghanistan''s forces consisted of many Soviet designed aircraft such as the
        [[Mi-17]] with which Ukrainian troops were very familiar with. In 2013 the
        contingent of troops in Afghanistan totaled 26 troops. As of 2014 the Ukrainian
        contingent was further drawn down and the team included 8 bomb disposal experts
        and several medical officers.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mil.gov.ua/news/2014/09/17/rozpochato-chergovu-%E2%80%93-8-rotacziyu-%E2%80%93-ukrainskogo-kontingentu/|title=\u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e

        veterans with various benefits. Ukrainians who have served in World War II,
        [[Soviet war in Afghanistan]], or as liquidators at the [[Chernobyl disaster]]
        are eligible for benefits such as; a monthly allowance, discount on medical
        and pharmacy services, free use of public transportation, additional vacation
        days from work, having priority for retention in case of work layoffs, easier
        loan access and approval process, preference when applying for security related
        positions, priority when applying to vocation school or trade school, and
        electricity, gas, and housing subsidies. Veterans are also eligible to stay
        at military sanatoriums permitting there is space. Since gaining independence
        Ukraine has deployed troops to Kosovo, Iraq, and Afghanistan gaining a new
        generation of veterans separate from those who have served in the Soviet forces.
        Most recently the government passed a law extending veteran benefits to Ukrainian
        troops participating in the [[2014 Russian invasion of Ukraine]]. Moreover,
        veterans from other nations who move to or reside in Ukraine may be eligible
        for some of the listed benefits, this provision was likely made to ensure
        World War II, Chernobyl, and Afghanistan veterans from other Soviet states
        who moved to Ukraine received similar benefits, however as Ukraine has participated
        in numerous NATO led conflicts since its independence it is unclear if NATO
        veterans would be extended these benefits.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://timlawyer.com.ua/lgoti-voenoslugashim-uchastnikam-ato/|title=Benefits

        groups are not as developed as in the United States which has numerous well
        known national organizations such as the [[Veterans of Foreign Wars]]. World
        War II veterans, and even persons who have lived through the war are generally
        treated with the highest respect. Other veterans are not as well known. Ukrainian
        veterans from the Soviet War of Afghanistan are strikingly similar to the
        Vietnam veterans of the United States. The Soviet Union generally kept the
        public in the dark through the war, unlike in Vietnam where coverage was very
        high, Afghanistan is often labeled as a mistake by the Soviet Union and its
        successor states, the lack of media coverage and censorship through the war
        also ensured that many still remain unaware of their nations involvement in
        the conflict.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vvaw.org/veteran/article/?id=61&print=yes|title=Vietnam

        The group was active until 1981 when all members were jailed.\n\nThe group''s
        goal was to monitor the Soviet Government''s compliance with the [[Helsinki
        Accords]], which ensure [[human rights]]. The members of the group based the
        group''s legal viability on the provision in the [[Helsinki Accords|Helsinki
        Final Act]], Principle VII, which established the rights of individuals to
        know and act upon their rights and duties.\n\n==Details==\nSince 1977 the
        Ukrainian Helsinki Group foreign affiliate began its activities with the participation
        of [[Pyotr Grigorenko|Petro Hryhorenko]], [[Nadiya Svitlychna]], [[Leonid
        Plyushch]] and later  Nina Strokata-Karavanska Nadiya Svitlichna began to
        host the human rights themed radio programs on [[Radio Svoboda|Svoboda]] radio.\n\nFrom
        the very early days the group endured the repressions of Soviet authorities.
        In February 1977 the authorities began to arrest members of the Ukrainian
        Helsinki Group, and within two years all the founding members were tried and
        sentenced to exile or imprisonment for 7 to 10 years.<ref name=\"Zinkevych\">{{cite

        the end of 1979, six members of the group were forced to emigrate, while other
        Ukrainian dissidents were not allowed to do so. Soviet authorities used [[Political
        abuse of psychiatry in the Soviet Union|punitive medicine]]: some Ukrainian
        Helsinki Group members (Oksana Meshko, [[Vasyl Stus]], Petro Sichko and his
        son Vasyl) were threatened with committal. Hanna Mykhailenko, who was a sympathizer
        of the Group, was detained in a psychiatric hospital in 1980. Bad conditions
        in Soviet camps and prisons caused the deaths of UHG members Oleksiy Tykhy
        and Vasyl Stus later on.\n\nIn 1982 the Initiative Group for the Defense of
        Believers and the Church was established, which considered itself a part of
        the Helsinki movement in Ukraine.<ref>{{cite news|author=Strokata, Nina|title=10th

        Yosyp Terelia and Vasyl Kobryn, were both sentenced in 1985.\n\nSome political
        prisoners from outside of Ukraine (an Estonian Mart Niklus and a Lithuanian
        Viktoras Petkus) announced their symbolical membership in the Group in 1983.\n\nBy
        1983 the Ukrainian Helsinki Group had 37 members, of whom 22 were in prison
        camps, 5 were in exile, 6 emigrated to the West, 3 were released and were
        living in Ukraine, 1 ([[Mykhailo Melnyk]]) committed suicide.<ref name=\"Zinkevych\"
        />\n\nOn July 7, 1988 members of group established and officially registered
        the Ukrainian Helsinki Association which in 1990 transformed itself into the
        [[Ukrainian Republican Party]]. In 2004, the [[Ukrainian Helsinki Human Rights
        Union]] was established as association of public human rights organizations.\n\n==
        Members ==\nBy the estimations of Vasyl Ovsyenko, the Group involved 41 persons
        in total. About 27 of them were sentenced by Soviet authorities to prisons
        and camps directly for their membership in the association. They spent altogether
        about 170 years in prisons, mental hospitals and in exile.\n\n===UHG abroad===\n*

        [[Ukraine]]. Popularly referred to as just ''''''\"Ukrainian House\"'''''',
        this five-storey building is the host venue for a variety of events from exhibitions,
        trade fairs and conferences to international association meetings, product
        launches, banquets, TV-ceremonies, sporting events, etc.\n\n== Location ==\n\nUkrainian
        House is situated on 2 [[Khreshchatyk Street]], overlooking [[European Square,
        Kiev|European Square]] in the heart of the Ukrainian capital. The rear of
        the center adjoins the southern outskirts of the [[Volodymyrska Hill]] Park.
        The building is not far from the main square of the country - [[Maidan Nezalezhnosti|Maidan
        (Independence Square)]], as well as Dnipro Hotel, Khreschatyk Hotel and [[Hotel
        Ukrayina|Hotel Ukraine]].\n\nVisitors can easily reach Ukrainian House by
        any public transport including the [[Kiev Metro]]. On-site parking space is
        also available. All major attractions of the city are within a walking distance
        from the center such as [[Maidan Nezalezhnosti|Independence Square]], [[Sophia
        Cathedral|St.Sophia\u2019s Cathedral]], [[Golden Domed Saint Michael\u00b4s
        monastery|Michael\u2019s Golden Dome Monastery]], [[Andriyivskyy Descent|Andrew\u2019s
        Street (Uzviz)]] with souvenirs, and numerous shopping centers, fine restaurants
        and hotels.\n\n== History and use ==\n\nBuilt in 1978\u20131982, this [[Monumental
        sculpture|monumental]] building was originally erected as a Kiev affiliate
        of the All-Union Lenin Museum, displaying materials documenting [[Lenin]]''s
        life. The building was designed and built by the \"Chief Kyiv Project\" architects
        group led by Vadym Hopkalo, with assistance by Vadym Hrechyna, Volodymyr Kolomiyets,
        and Leonid Filenko. In 1985 the authors of the project received the [[Shevchenko
        National Prize|Shevchenko State Prize of the Ukrainian SSR]].\n\nSince 1938
        the Kiev city exhibition of the All-Union Lenin Museum was located in [[Building
        of Pedagogical Museum|Teacher House]] at 57 Volodymyr Street. The museum was
        moved to the Ukrainian House building when it was opened in 1982, where it
        remained until after the dissolution of the [[Soviet Union]]. On April 2,
        1993 the building was renamed and converted to a conference and exhibition
        hall. The Lenin museum exhibition was dismounted and placed into storage funds.\n\nIn
        2004 the entire collection of the Museum of the History of Kyiv was moved
        from its location at the [[Klov Palace]] to the fourth and fifth floor of
        Ukrainian House, where much of the collection remains to this day.\n\n== Operations

        also|History of Christianity in Ukraine}}\n\n===Ecumenical Patriarchate of
        Constantinople===\n\n====Moscow, Lithuania, Halych metropolia====\nThe Ukrainian
        Orthodox Church considers itself the sole descendant in modern Ukraine of
        the Ruthenian (Kyivan) metropolis within the jurisdiction of the [[Ecumenical
        Patriarchate of Constantinople]] [[Baptism of Kievan Rus''|established]] in
        Kiev in the 10th century. Due to [[Mongol invasion of Rus''|invasion of the
        Mongols]] in the 13th century the metropolitan seat was moved to [[Vladimir,
        Russia|Vladimir]] and later to [[Moscow]], while in the Duchy of Halych and
        Volhynia was created a separate Metropolis of Halych with own Metropolitan.
        In the 14th century the Grand Duke of Lithuania [[Algirdas]] who established
        his control over the former territories of [[Kievan Rus]] attempted to move
        the metropolitan seat back to Kiev.\n\n====Revival====\nIn 1596 the Metropolitan
        of Kiev, Halych and all Russia [[Michael Rohoza]] accepted the [[Union of
        Brest]] transforming dioceses of the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople]]
        into the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]] under the [[Holy See]]''s jurisdiction.
        In 1620 [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople]] reestablished its dioceses
        in Ukraine under the Metropolitan of Kiev, Galicia and all Russia as the exarch
        of Ukraine [[Job Boretsky]].\n\n===Merger into the Russian Orthodox Church===\nIn
        1685 the Ukrainian Orthodox Church came under the jurisdiction of the [[Russian
        Orthodox Church]] when Gedeon Svyatopolk-Chetvertynsky was elected the Metropolitan
        of Kyiv, Galicia and all Russia with the help of the [[Hetman of Zaporizhian
        Host]] [[Ivan Samoylovych]]. At that time all six eparchies ([[diocese]]s)
        of the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople]] in Ukraine were transferred
        to the [[Russian Orthodox Church]]. The original eparchies included Kiev,
        Chernihiv, Mstislav-Mogilev (Belorusian) on the left bank of Dnieper and Lviv,
        Lutsk, Peremyshl on the right bank of Dnieper. Since his election Gedeon lost
        practically all his eparchies. Due to the conflilct with [[Lazar Baranovich]],
        Metropolitan of Kiev ceded the Chernihiv eparchy under direct jurisdiction
        of the Russian Orthodox Church in 1686, while the Belorusia eparchy was already
        de facto administered from Moscow by that time. On 27 January 1688 the Russian
        Orthodox Church changed the title of Gedeon to Metropolitan of Kiev, Halych
        and Little Russia. Already the Gedeon''s successor [[Metropolitan Varlaam
        (Yasinski)|Metropolitan Varlaam]] during 1692 to 1702 lost the rest of his
        eparchies in Lviv, Peremyshl and Lutsk that were transferred to the [[Ukrainian
        Greek Catholic Church]]. Due to the reduction in number of eparchies, the
        eparchy of Pereyaslav was revived, commemorating the [[council of Pereyaslav]].
        In 1728-72 the Belorusian eparchy became the only Eastern Orthodox eparchy
        in Poland and was directly governed by the Patriarch of Moscow.\n\nBefore
        the [[Battle of Poltava (1708)|Battle of Poltava]] when [[Ivan Mazepa]] sided
        with [[Carl XII]], the new [[Metlopolitan Ioasaf (Krokovsky)|Metropolitan
        Ioasaf]] along with bishops of Chernihiv and Pereyaslav was summoned by [[Peter
        the Great]] to [[Hlukhiv]] where they were ordered to declare an [[anathema]]
        onto Mazepa. After the battle of Poltava, in 1709 Metropolitan Ioasaf was
        exiled to [[Tver]] and in 1710 a church censorship was introduced to the Kiev
        metropolia. In 1718 Metropolitan Ioasaf was arrested and exiled to [[Saint
        Petersburg]] for interrogation where he died. In 1720 an edict is issued,
        according to which all Ukrainian publishers are required to change to the
        Russian language. During that time in 1718 to 1722 the Metropolitan seat in
        Kiev was vacant and ruled by the Kiev Spiritual Consistory (under the authority
        of the [[Most Holy Synod]]), since 1722 it was occupied by Archbishop Varlaam,
        thus being downgraded to a regular eparchy. Also since 1721 the Russian Orthodox
        Church itself was governed by the Most Holy Synod rather than Patriarch.\n\n===Synod
        period===\nIn 1730 the new Archbishop Varlaam with all members of the Kiev
        Spiritual Consistory were put on trial by the Privy Chancellery. After being
        convicted, Varlaam as a simple monk was exiled to the [[Kirillo-Belozersky
        Monastery]] in Vologda region where he served a sentence of imprisonment of
        10 years. After the death of the Russian Empress [[Anna of Russia|Anna]] in
        1740, Varlaam was allowed to return and recovered all his [[Archiereus]] titles.
        He however refused to except back those titles and, after asked to be left
        in peace, moved to the [[Tikhvin Assumption Monastery]]. In 1750 Varlaam accepted
        the [[Degrees of Eastern Orthodox monasticism#Great Schema|Great Schema]]
        under the name of Vasili and soon died in 1751.\n\nThe newly appointed archbishop
        of Kiev [[Raphael Zaborovsky]] (in 1730) after some 25 years had revived the
        metropolitan rank for the [[Eparchy of Kiev (Moscow Patriarchate)|Kiev eparchy]]
        in 1743 as the Metropolitan of Kiev, Halych and Little Russia.\n\nOn 2 April
        1767 the Empress of Russia [[Catherine the Great]] issued an edict stripping
        the title of the Metropolitan of Kiev of the words \"and all Little Russia\".<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20150416145158/http://www.pravenc.ru/text/76238.html

        the metropolitan seat in Kiev was placed [[Metropolitan Serapion (Aleksandrovsky)|Metropolitan
        Serapion]], a bishop from Russia (from the Vladimir region). Since 1803 and
        until 1930 the heads of [[Eparchy of Kiev (Moscow Patriarchate)|Kiev eparchy]]
        were exclusively from Russia.\n\n===Fall of monarchy in Russia and Exarchate===\n{{see

        the advance of the Soviet troops on Kiev (see [[Ukrainian\u2013Soviet War]]),
        in January 1918 was killed the Metropolitan of Kiev [[Vladimir Bogoyavlensky]]
        by unknown people. Metropolitan Bogoyavlensky chaired the All-Ukrainian Church
        Council that took a break between its sessions on 18 January 1918 and was
        to be resumed in May 1918. On 23\u201324 January 1918 the Red Guards of [[Reinholds
        B\u0113rzi\u0146\u0161]] occupied the city of Kiev. In the evening of 25 January
        1918 Metropolitan Vladimir was found dead between walls of the Old Pechersk
        Fortress beyond the Gates of All Saints.\n\nIn May 1918 to the [[Eparchy of
        Kiev (Moscow Patriarchate)|Kiev eparchy]] was appointed Metropolitan of Kiev
        and Halych [[Antony (Khrapovitsky)|Antony]], a former candidate to become
        the [[Patriarch of Moscow]] at the [[1917\u201318 Local Council of the Russian
        Orthodox Church|Russian Local Council]] of 1917 and losing it to the [[Patriarch
        Tikhon of Moscow|Patriarch Tikhon]]. In July 1918 Metropolitan Antony became
        the head of the All-Ukrainian Church Council. Eventually he sided with the
        Russian [[White movement]] supporting the Denikin''s forces of [[South Russia
        (1919\u20131920)|South Russia]], while keeping the title of Metropolitan of
        Kiev and Halych. After the defeat of the Whites and the exile of Antony, in
        1919-21 the metropolitan seat was temporarily held by the bishop of Cherkasy
        Nazariy (also the native of [[Kazan]]). After the arrest of Nazariy by the
        Soviet authorities in 1921, the seat was provisionally held by the bishop
        of Grodno and newly elected Exarch of Ukraine Mikhail, a member of the Russian
        [[Black Hundreds]] nationalistic movement. After his arrest in 1923, the Kiev
        eparchy was provisionally headed by various bishops of neighboring eparchies
        until 1927. After his return in 1927 Mikhail became the Metropolitan of Kiev
        and Exarch of Ukraine until his death in 1929.\n\nIn 1945, after the integration
        of [[Zakarpattia Oblast]] into [[USSR]], eastern parts of the [[Eparchy of
        Muka\u010devo and Pre\u0161ov]] were transferred from the supreme jurisdiction
        of [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] to the jurisdiction of the Exarchate of Russian
        Orthodox Church in Ukraine, and new [[Eparchy of Muka\u010devo and U\u017egorod]]

        succeeded [[Filaret (Denysenko)]], was enthroned in 1992 as the Primate of
        the UOC under the title [[Metropolitan of Kiev and all Ukraine]], with the
        official residency in the [[Kiev Pechersk Lavra]], which also houses all of
        the Church''s administration.\n\nThe church is currently the only Ukrainian
        church to have full [[canon law|canonical standing]] in Eastern Orthodoxy,
        and operates in [[full communion]] with the [[Eastern Orthodox Church organization|other
        Eastern Orthodox Churches]]. The UOC (MP) claims to be the largest religious
        body in Ukraine with the greatest number of parishes churches and communities
        counting up to half of the total in Ukraine and totaling over 10,000. The
        UOC also claims to have up to 75&nbsp;percent of the Ukrainian population.<ref>Pravoslvieye

        Independent surveys show significant variance. According to [[Stratfor]],
        in 2008, more than 50 percent of Ukrainian population belong to the Ukrainian
        Orthodox Church under the Moscow Patriarch.<ref name=\"Countries in Crisis:

        tend to show greater adherence to the rival [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church of

        \"What religious group do you belong to?\". Sociology poll by [[Razumkov Centre]]
        about the religious situation in Ukraine (2006)]</ref> Many Orthodox Ukrainians
        do not clearly identify with a particular denomination and, sometimes, are
        even unaware of the affiliation of the church they attend as well as of the
        controversy itself, which indicates the difficulty of using survey numbers
        as an indicator of a relative strength of the church. Also, the geographical
        factor plays a major role in the number of adherents, as the Ukrainian population
        tends to be more churchgoing in the western part of the country rather than
        in the UOC (MP)''s heartland in southern and eastern Ukraine. Many in Ukraine
        see the UOC-MP as merely a tool of the Putin Government.\n\nThe number of
        parishes statistics seems to be more reliable and consistent even though it
        may not necessarily directly translate into the numbers of adherents. By number
        of parishes and quantity of church buildings, the UOC (MP)''s strong base
        is central and northernwestern Ukraine. However, percentage wise (with respect
        to rival Orthodox Churches) its share of parishes there varies from 60 to
        70 percent. At the same time, by percentage alone (with respect to rival Orthodox
        Churches) the urban [[russophone]] southern and eastern Ukrainian provinces
        peak with up to 90 percent of church buildings. The same can be said about
        [[Zakarpattia Oblast|Transcarpathia]], although there the UOC''s main rival
        is the Greek Catholic Church and thus in all its share is only 40 percent.
        The capital [[Kiev]] is where the greatest Orthodox rivalry takes place, there
        the UOC (MP) has only half of the Orthodox communities. The only place where
        the UOC (MP) is a true minority, in both quantity, percentage and support
        are the former Galician provinces of Western Ukraine. There the total share
        of parishes does not exceed more than five percent. The UOC (MP) does not
        have any parishes abroad, as its followers identify themselves under the same
        umbrella as those of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]].\n\nAs of 2006 the Ukrainian
        Orthodox Church had the allegiance of 10,875 registered religious communities
        in Ukraine (approximately 68 percent of all Orthodox Christian communities
        in the country), located mostly in central, eastern and southern regions and
        claims to be the largest religious body in terms of church property in Ukraine.\n\nSince
        2014 the church has come under attack for perceived [[anti-Ukrainian]] and

        [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] in [[Canada]], primarily consisting of Orthodox
        [[Ukrainian Canadian]]s.  Its former name was the ''''''Ukrainian Greek Orthodox
        Church of Canada (UGOCC)''''''.  The Church, currently a Metropolis of the
        [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople]], is part of the wider [[Eastern
        Orthodox communion]], however was created independently in 1918.\n\nIt has
        [[cathedral]]s in many Canadian cities including [[Holy Trinity Ukrainian
        Orthodox Metropolitan Cathedral|Winnipeg]], [[Holy Trinity Ukrainian Orthodox
        Cathedral (Saskatoon)|Saskatoon]], [[Holy Trinity Ukrainian Orthodox Cathedral
        (Vancouver)|Vancouver]], [[St. John''s Cathedral, Edmonton|Edmonton]], [[St.
        Volodymyr''s Ukrainian Orthodox Cathedral (Toronto)|Toronto]], and [[St. Sophie''s
        Ukrainian Orthodox Cathedral (Montreal)|Montreal]].  The [[Metropolitan bishop|Metropolitan]]
        Cathedral, seminary ([[St. Andrew''s College (Winnipeg)|St. Andrew''s College]]),
        and central administrative office are all based in Winnipeg.  Also the Church
        is affiliated with four residences for university students: [[St. Vladimir''s
        Institute (Toronto)|St. Vladimir''s]] in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]]; [[St. Petro
        Mohyla Institute]] in [[Saskatoon]], [[Saskatchewan]]; [[St. John''s Institute
        (Edmonton)|St. John''s Institute]] in [[Edmonton]], [[Alberta]]; and one operating
        at St. Andrew''s College.  The Church''s membership is about ten thousand.
        The current [[Primate (bishop)|Primate]] of the Church is [[Yurij (Kalistchuk)|Metropolitan
        Yurij (Kalistchuk)]].\n\n==Early history ==\nMost ethnic [[Ukrainians]] moving
        to [[Canada]] from [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]] ([[Western Ukraine]])
        in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries were [[Greek Catholic]]s,
        and were tended early on by the local [[Roman Catholic]] hierarchy until the
        creation of the [[Archeparchy of Winnipeg|Ukrainian Greek Catholic Exarchate]]
        in 1912.  This was because the North American Roman Catholic bishops believed
        that the presence of married Eastern Catholic priests would create a scandal
        at the time.  The other major group of Ukrainians which were coming to Canada
        were from [[Bukovina]], and they were mostly Orthodox.  At first these Orthodox
        Christians were served by the [[Orthodox Church in America|Russian Orthodox
        Mission in North America]] (which at that time was part of the [[Russian Orthodox
        Church]]), but these services were not conducted in their native [[Ukrainian
        language]].  Catholics and the Orthodox who wanted to establish their own
        church met in the summer of 1918 in the city of [[Saskatoon, Saskatchewan]]
        and established the ''''''Ukrainian Greek Orthodox Church in Canada''''''.  Also
        at these meetings, the delegates (mostly from [[Alberta]], [[Saskatchewan]]
        and [[Manitoba]]) had established a Brotherhood to try to help the young church.\n\nThe
        settlers had just created a new Church, but they were very conscious of Church
        Canon Law that states that a Church cannot exist without a bishop. The Church''s
        Brotherhood tried to have Archbishop Alexander of the [[Orthodox Church in
        America|Russian Orthodox Mission]] to take the Church under his temporary
        care as [[Bishop]].  At first Archbishop Alexander agreed, but later declined;
        however, the UGOC''s First Sobor (Church Council) still took place as planned
        on December 28, 1918 in Saskatoon.  This Sobor led to the establishment of
        the Church''s first [[seminary]] in Saskatoon.  The Brotherhood still searched
        for a temporary Bishop, and eventually found one: Metropolitan [[Germanos
        (Shehadi)]], who was the Metropolitan of the [[Antiochian Orthodox Christian
        Archdiocese of North America]].  He led the Church for the next 5 years (1919-1924).  Under
        his supervision, Sobor II took place in Saskatoon on November 27, 1919.\n\n==
        Archbishop John (Theodorovich) ==\nFollowing Metropolitan Germanos'' leadership,
        Archbishop [[John (Theodorovich)]] became the Church''s [[Primate (bishop)|Primate]].
        Archbishop John had just arrived in the [[United States]] from the non-canonical
        [[Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church]], and he began to serve the [[Ukrainian
        Orthodox Church of the USA]] to become their Primate and Metropolitan. The
        young Church had chosen the Ukrainian [[bishop]] as their bishop, hoping that
        the Church would further grow under his leadership. During the summers from
        1924 to 1946 Archbishop John would make an annual trip to [[Canada]] to visit
        the parishes throughout the country.  When Archbishop John was in the USA
        during the winter months, a Fr. [[Semen Sawchuk]] would act as an administrator
        at the Consistory in Canada.\n\nAfter a few years as acting Primate of the
        UOCC, certain controversies laid around Archbishop John, due to his uncanonical
        ordination to bishop.  Archbishop John was \"ordained\" by the \"bishops\"
        of [[Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church]], who were not ordained according
        to the canon laws and traditions of the Orthodox Church, but were ordained
        by priests and lay people.  The 1st Canon of the Holy Apostles states that
        new bishops should be ordained by at least 2 or 3 bishops.  As a result of
        this, Archbishop John resigned his position as ruling bishop in 1946.\n\nAt
        a special Sobor in 1947, Bishop [[Mstyslav (Skrypnyk)]] was accepted as the
        new ''''Archbishop of Winnipeg and all Canada''''.  However, due to some misunderstandings,
        and arguments about how the Church should be governed (mostly between himself
        and Semen Sawchuk), he resigned as Primate in 1950 at X Sobor in [[Winnipeg]].
        In response the UOCC contacted Metropolitan [[Polycarp (Sikorski)]] (who was
        the head of the [[Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church|Ukrainian Autocephalous
        Orthodox Church Abroad]], composed of refugee bishops formerly affiliated
        with the Polish Orthodox Church in German-occupied Ukraine) for assistance,
        and he agreed to send some bishops over to help the faithful in Canada.\n\n==Formation
        of the Metropolia==\nAt a special sobor in 1947 the UGOCC accepted Bishop
        [[Mstyslav (Skrypnyk)]] of Pereyaslav of the UAOC, consecrated during World
        War II with the blessing of Metropolitan [[Dionysius (Waledy\u0144ski)]] of
        Warsaw, as its ruling bishop with the title \"Archbishop of Winnipeg and All
        Canada\".<ref>http://www.uocc.ca/en-ca/about/history/</ref> Due to conflicts
        between Archbishop Mstyslav and members of the UGOCC Consistory, however,
        the former resigned as diocesan bishop at the tenth sobor of the Church in
        1950, once again leaving the UGOCC without a bishop.\n\nAfter the resignation
        of Archbishop Mstyslav the Consistory appealed to Metropolitan Polycarp of
        the UAOC for assistance in finding bishops for the UGOCC. By the time another
        special sobor was called in 1951 four potential bishops, all consecrated in
        German-occupied Ukraine during World War II, had been found. One, Metropolitan
        [[Hilarion (Ohienko)]] of Kholm, had been resident in Winnipeg since 1947.
        Two others, Archbishop [[Michael (Khoroshy)]] and Bishop [[Platon (Artemiuk)]],
        came to Canada at the invitation of the Consistory and with the blessing of
        Metropolitan Polycarp.\n\nAt the 1951 sobor it was decided that the UGOCC,
        which had grown to include some 300 parishes, would be organized as a [[metropolitanate|metropolia]].
        Metropolitan Ilarion was elected Metropolitan of Winnipeg and All Canada and
        primate of the UGOCC, while Archbishop Michael was elected [[Archbishop of
        Toronto and Eastern Canada]]. (Bishop Platon had died shortly after his arrival
        in Canada.) The size of the UGOCC necessitated the appointment of more bishops,
        and so in 1959 [[Archimandrite]] [[Andrew (Metiuk)]] was elected [[Archbishop
        of Toronto and Eastern Canada|Bishop of Edmonton and Western Canada]] and
        in 1963 Archimandrite [[Boris (Yakovkevych)]] was elected Bishop of Saskatoon
        and auxiliary or assistant bishop of the Central Eparchy under Metropolitan
        Ilarion.\n\nAfter 21 years as primate of the UGOCC, Metropolitan Ilarion died
        on March 29, 1972, and was succeeded by Archbishop Michael of Toronto as Metropolitan
        of Winnipeg and All Canada. After Metropolitan Michael\u2019s retirement in
        1975 Archbishop Andrew (Metiuk) was elected metropolitan, serving until his
        death on February 2, 1985. Under Metropolitan Andrew new bishops, Bishops
        [[Mikolaj (Debryn)]], [[Basil (Fedak)]], and [[John (Stinka)]], were elected
        to serve the UGOCC, and after Metropolitan Andrew\u2019s death Bishop Wasyly
        was elected Metropolitan of Winnipeg and All Canada. Four years after his
        enthronement as primate of the UGOCC Metropolitan Wasyly consecrated Archimandrite
        Yurij (Kalistchuk) as Bishop of Saskatoon.\n\n==Recent history==\nAfter dialoguing
        with the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople|Church of Constantinople]]
        the UGOCC was received into its jurisdiction as the Ukrainian Orthodox Church
        of Canada in 1990, bringing it into the full communion of the canonical [[Orthodox
        Christianity|Orthodox Church]] [http://www.uocc.ca/en-ca/about/history/].
        (Several years later its sister church, the [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church of
        the USA|Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Diaspora]], also joined the Patriarchate
        of Constantinople.) The decree of [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Ecumenical
        Patriarch]] [[Patriarch Demetrios I of Constantinople|Demetrius (Papadopoulos)]]
        uniting the UOCC with the Church of Constantinople recognized the Church\u2019s
        internal autonomy under its metropolitan, justifying the reception of the
        UOCC into the Patriarchate\u2019s jurisdiction on the basis of the historic
        jurisdiction of the Church of Constantinople in Ukraine.\n\nFollowing the
        death of Metropolitan Wasyly in early 2005 the twenty-first sobor of the UOCC
        elected Archbishop John as Metropolitan of Winnipeg and Canada. In August
        2008 an extraordinary sobor was held in Saskatoon to elect new bishops, amend
        the UOCC\u2019s bylaws, and mark the 90th anniversary of the founding of the
        UOCC in the city [http://www.uocc.ca/pdf/sobor/Sobor%20Communique%20Day%2022-08-08.pdf].
        The sobor elected Bishops [[Ilarion (Rudnyk)]] of Telmessos as Bishop of Edmonton
        and [[Andriy (Peshko)]] of Krateia as auxiliary Bishop of Saskatoon.\n\nIn
        July 2010 another special sobor of the UOCC was held to nominate a successor
        to the newly retired Metropolitan John. The sobor nominated Archbishop [[Yurij
        (Kalistchuk)]] of Toronto for the metropolitanate, and consequently on August
        30, 2010, the Holy Synod in Constantinople elected Archbishop Yurij as Archbishop
        of Winnipeg and Metropolitan of Canada.\n\n==Structure==\nThe UOCC is divided
        into three eparchies or dioceses, the [[Archbishop of Toronto and Eastern
        Canada|Eastern Eparchy]], with its cathedral in Toronto, Ontario; the [[Ukrainian
        Orthodox Eparchy of Central Canada|Central Eparchy]], with its cathedral in
        Winnipeg, Manitoba; and the [[Archbishop of Edmonton and Western Canada|Western
        Eparchy]], with its cathedral in Edmonton, Alberta. According to the custom
        of the UOCC the Church''s primate is the titled the \"Archbishop of Winnipeg
        and Metropolitan of Canada\" and serves as the diocesan or ruling bishop of
        the Central Eparchy.\n\nThe Eastern Eparchy currently does not have a ruling
        bishop, but is administered by Bishop [[Andriy (Peshko)]] of Krateia. The
        Western Eparchy is led by Bishop [[Ilarion (Rudnyk)]] of Edmonton and Western
        Canada. All of the UOCC''s dioceses may have auxiliary bishops (titled ''Bishop
        of Vancouver'' in the Western Eparchy, ''Bishop of Saskatoon'' in the Central
        Eparchy and ''Bishop of Montreal'' in the Eastern Eparchy), but none of the
        Eparchies have an auxiliary bishop at this time.{{when|date=May 2013}}\n\n==Current

        ''''Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Kyivan Patriarchate, UOC-KP'''') is one
        of the three major [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Orthodox]] [[Christian denomination|church]]es
        in [[Ukraine]], alongside the [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate)]],
        and the [[Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church]].<ref name=CIA/> The church
        is currently unrecognized by canonical Eastern Orthodox churches, although
        now the Ecumenical Patriarchate who is the Mother Church, and alone can only
        grant canonical status and autocephaly is examining the request and petition
        of the Ukrainian Government and its people to be officially recognised.<ref
        name=RISU-KP/>\n\nThe UOC-KP''s [[Mother Church]] is in the [[St Volodymyr''s
        Cathedral|St. Volodymyr''s Cathedral]] in [[Kiev]], the capital of Ukraine.
        The head of the church is [[Patriarch Filaret (Denysenko)]], who was enthroned
        in 1995. [[Filaret (Denysenko)|Patriarch Filaret]] was excommunicated by the
        [[Russian Orthodox Church]] in 1997,<ref name=Sobor2008/> but the Synod and
        Sobor of the UOC-KP do not recognize this action.\n\n==Formation==\nThe church
        originated in 1992 as a result of a schism between the [[Moscow Patriarchate]]
        and its former [[locum tenens]], Metropolitan of Kiev and all Ukraine Filaret,
        when Filaret chose to convert his former see (of which he was head for more
        than two decades) into a Ukrainian [[autocephalous church]], initially within
        the legal framework of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]]. The majority of the
        Pro-Russian bishops refused to support him, and forced him to resign his position.
        Undeterred, Filaret, with support of the President of Ukraine, Leonid Kravchuk,
        initiated a merger with the  [[Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church]].
        With the support of nationalist groups such as [[UNA-UNSO]], the church fought
        for control over property. In response, almost all Pro-Russian bishops called
        a [[Synod#Orthodox usage|sobor]] in [[Kharkiv]], where they refused to follow
        Filaret, and ruled to [[defrock]] and [[anathema|anathemise]] him. However
        the union between the Western Ukrainian and diaspora clergy of the former
        UAOC and the now ''defrocked'' Russian Orthodox clergy who followed Filaret,
        became very fragile. After the death of [[Patriarch Mstyslav (Stepan Skrypnyk)|Patriarch
        Mstyslav]] in the summer of 1993, the union reached a breaking point causing
        the UAOC to terminate the union. After a brief leadership of [[Patriarch Volodomyr
        (Romaniuk)]], Filaret assumed the Patriarchal throne in autumn 1995.\n[[File:1

        in Ukrainian in Israel]]\n\n==History==\nOrthodoxy (and Christianity in general)
        in Ukraine date to the [[Christianization of Kievan Rus]] by [[Volodymyr the
        Great]] as a [[Metropolitanate]] of the Patriarch of Constantinople. The sacking
        of Kiev itself in December 1240 during the [[Mongol invasion of Rus|Mongol
        Invasion]] led to the ultimate collapse of the Rus'' state. For many of its
        residents, the brutality of Mongol attacks sealed the fate of many choosing
        to find safe haven in the North East. In 1299, the Kievan [[Metropolitan bishop|Metropolitan]]
        Chair was moved to [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]] by Metropolitan [[Maximus,
        Metropolitan of all Rus|Maximus]], keeping the title ''''of Kiev''''. As Vladimir-Suzdal,
        and later the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]] continued to grow unhindered, the
        Orthodox religious link between them and Kiev remained strong. The fall of
        Constantinople in 1453 allowed the once daughter church of North East to become
        autocephalous with Kiev remaining part of the Ecumenical Patriarchate. From
        that moment on, the Churches of Ukraine and Russia went their own separate
        ways. The latter became central in the growing [[Russian Tsardom]], attaining
        patriarchal status in 1589, whilst the former became subject to repression
        and Polonization efforts, particularly after the [[Union of Brest]] in 1596.
        Eventually the persecution of Orthodox Ukrainians led to a massive rebellion
        under [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky]] and united the Ukrainian [[Cossack Hetmanate|Hetmanate]]
        with the Russian Tsardom, and in 1686, the Kievan Metropolia came under the
        Moscow Patriarchate. Ukrainian clergy, for their Greek training, held key
        roles in the Russian Orthodox Church until the end of the 18th century. Examples
        include [[Epifany Slavinetsky]], one of the architects of the [[Patriarch
        Nikon]]''s church reforms in the 17th century. [[Epifany Slavinetsky]], [[locum
        tenens]] after [[Patriarch Adrian]]''s death in 1700 and Metropolitan of Moscow,
        and his successor [[Feofan Prokopovich]], a reformer of Russian Orthodox Church
        in early 18th century.\n\nOrthodoxy in Ukraine greatly expanded in the 18th
        and 19th centuries, particularly as the boundaries of Russian Empire incorporated
        the Crimean Khanate, Bessarabia and Right-Bank Ukraine. Only the Western province
        of [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] remained outside the Russian Orthodox
        Church (though it was claimed as canonical territory, as it was in the official
        Kievan Metropolitan title ''''of Kiev and Galich''''). During the 20th century,
        Orthodoxy was brutally persecuted by the Soviet authorities in Soviet Ukraine,
        and, to lesser extent, by the authorities of the Second Polish Republic in
        Volhynia.\n\nWhat historians now see as the reason for the following events
        was the decision of the head of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church Metropolitan
        of Kiev and all Ukraine [[Patriarch Filaret (Mykhailo Denysenko)|Filaret]]
        to achieve total [[autocephaly]] (independence) of his [[metropolitan see]]
        with or without the approval of the [[mother church]] as required by [[canon
        law]]. These events followed Filaret''s own unsuccessful attempt to gain a
        seat in the [[Moscow Patriarch]] for himself (1990) and Ukrainian independence
        after the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in August, 1991. In November
        1991, Metropolitan Filaret requested that the hierarchy of the [[Russian Orthodox
        Church]] grant the Ukrainian Orthodox Church autocephalous status. The skeptical
        hierarchy of the Russian Orthodox Church called for a full Synodical council
        (Sobor) where this issue would have been discussed at length. Filaret, using
        support from old friendship ties with the then newly elected [[President of
        Ukraine]] ([[Leonid Kravchuk]]), convinced him that a new independent government
        should have its own independent church. Although the UAOC lacked any significant
        following outside [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]], Filaret was able to
        organise a covert communion with the UAOC in case the [[Moscow Patriarchate]]
        refused.\n\nAt the synod in March\u2013April 1992, however, most of the clergy
        of the UOC-Russian who initially supported Filaret, openly criticised this
        move, and put most of the other bishops against him. He was asked to resign.\n\nUpon
        returning to Kyiv, Filaret carried out his reserve option claiming that the
        retirement swore was given under pressure and that he is not resigning. The
        Ukrainian president [[Leonid Kravchuk]] gave Filaret his support as did the
        [[UNA-UNSO|nationalist Paramilitaries]], in retaining his rank. In a crisis
        moment the Hierarchical Council of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church agreed to
        another [[synod]] which met in May 1992. The council was conducted in the
        eastern city of [[Kharkiv]] where the majority of the Russian bishops voted
        to suspend Filaret from his clerical functioning. Simultaneously they elected
        a new leader [[Metropolitan Volodymyr (Viktor Sabodan)]], a native of the
        [[Khmelnytskyi Oblast]] and a former Patriarchal Exarch to [[Western Europe]].\n\nWith
        only three bishops remaining at his support Filaret initiated the unification
        with the UAOC, and in June 1992 created a new Ukrainian Orthodox Church \u2013
        Kyivan Patriarchate (UOC-KP) with 94-year-old [[Patriarch Mstyslav]] as the
        leader. While chosen as his assistant, Filaret was de facto ruling the Church.
        A few of the Autocephalous [[bishop]]s and clergy who opposed this situation
        refused to join the new Church following the death of Mstyslav a year later.
        The church was once again ripped apart by a schism and most of the UAOC parishes
        were regained when the churches re-separated in July 1993.\n\n==Canonical
        status==\nSince his election as a Patriarch in 1995, Filaret remains very
        active in both church and state politics. His goal is to gather around his
        Church all groups with a national{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} orientation
        and all church organizations which did not have [https://sites.google.com/site/canonsoc/
        canonical] recognition.<ref name=RISU-Filaret/> He expressed repentance for
        his past support of prosecution of Ukrainian national churches, the Autocephalous
        and the Greek Catholic.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} He is leading the
        drive for his church to become a single Orthodox Ukrainian national church.
        His attempts to gain ''canonical'' recognition for his church remain unsuccessful
        to this day (although the Ecumenical Patriarchate is now looking into the
        request of the Ukrainian Parliament and its people to grant canonical status
        to the church) and the [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate)|Ukrainian
        Orthodox Church]] canonically linked to the [[Moscow Patriarchate]] remains
        at this point the only body whose canonical standing is officially recognised.\n\nUOC-KP
        activity was also focused on attracting Ukrainians with ethnic-oriented rhetoric.\nFor
        example, in 1998, four parishes of [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the USA|UOC
        of USA]] moved under Filaret''s omophorion without canonical release from
        UOC of USA (a jurisdiction of the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople|Ecumenical
        Patriarchate]]). The Permanent Conference of Ukrainian Orthodox Bishops Beyond
        the Borders of Ukraine expressed its protest against the divisive activity
        of UOC-KP in diaspora with Open Letter, from 14 June 1998. In its turn, the
        Hierarchical Sobor of UOC-KP decided on 14 May 1999:\n\n[...] 11. To appeal
        for peace and the spiritual unity of the Ukrainian community, which in foreign
        countries during the last decades struggled for Ukrainian statehood and autocephalous
        Ukrainian Orthodox Church, so therefore the Ukrainian Orthodox Church Kyivan
        Patriarchate does not have the moral right to leave without spiritual care
        those Ukrainian Orthodox parishes in the diaspora which, from the time of
        His Holiness Patriarch of Kyiv and All Ukraine Mstyslav of blessed memory,
        remain under the omofor of the Kyivan Patriarch and further do not desire
        to change their canonical position. We categorically reject the accusations
        addressed to our Church as supporting division in the Ukrainian diaspora,
        expressed, in particular, in the \"Open Letter\" of the Permanent Conference
        of Ukrainian Orthodox Bishops Beyond the Borders of Ukraine, from 14 June
        1998.[...]<ref name=Sobor_KP/>\n\nThen, while addressing UOC of USA in November
        1999, Patriarch Filaret continued as follows:\n\"The question is not about
        uniting with the Kyiv Patriarchate, you already are part of the Kyiv Patriarchate.

        Orthodox Church of the USA'''''' (''''UOC of USA'''') is a jurisdiction of
        the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate]] (Greek Orthodox Patriarchate) in the [[United
        States]]. It consists of two eparchies ([[diocese]]s), ruled by two bishops,
        including about 85 active parishes and missions.  The Church''s current leader
        is Metropolitan Antony. The Church''s head offices and Consistory are based
        in [[South Bound Brook]], [[New Jersey]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Autocephalous
        Church===\n\nSeraphim Surrency writes:\n\n:''''Bishop Bohdan, with what backing
        the Greeks could give him, which was mostly moral and very little financial,
        continued to give some competition to the organization of Teodorovich, now
        commonly called the \"Ukrainian Metropolia\", but it was a losing battle.
        In addition to the administrative ineptitude of Spylka, his very moderation
        in matters Ukrainian seemed to work against him. Spylka succeeded in attracting
        some Americans who were interested in Orthodoxy and most in ordination. Spylka
        ordained over a dozen native converts to the Orthodox priesthood without requiring
        any theological education and as might be expected the results were disastrous
        (an exception was Fr. [[Dimitry Royster]] who later transferred his allegiance
        to the Russian Metropolia and was consecrated Bishop in 1969) (p. 113).''''\n\nIn
        1942, when persecution of the Church in Ukraine eased under the German occupation,
        a number of bishops were consecrated for the Ukrainian Orthodox Church there.
        One of these bishops, Archbishop [[Mstyslav (Skrypnyk)]], emigrated to Canada
        in 1948 to head the jurisdiction of the [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Canada]].
        In 1949, however, he moved to the U.S. and joined Spylkas'' group. After Archbishop
        Mstyslav''s departure from Canada (after a disagreement with the Canadian
        Church''s governance), the Canadian Church was headed by Metropolitan [[Hilarion
        Ohienko]]. Mstyslav desired the unity of the two jurisdictions and worked
        to reconcile the two churches and convince Teodorovych to accept re-consecration
        as a condition for union.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nIn 1950, the
        two rival jurisdictions held [[synod]]s (in the same cathedral in New York)
        at which unification was approved by both, and on October 13, a combined unification

        parishes under Spylka were unconvinced of the sincerity of the \"UOC of USA\"

        but it was not complete, lacking the support of Spylka and those who had convinced
        him to remain separate. Archbishop Mstyslav joined the new united church -
        the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the USA, along with a number of Spylkas''

        Antony [an Archbishop within the UOC-USA] was a candidate at the \u201cSobor\u201d
        [conclave] of the Mother Church in Kyiv, Ukraine, to succeed him as Patriarch
        of the UOC-Ukraine. Archbishop Antony subsequently was unsuccessful in his
        candidacy, and shortly thereafter, together with his followers within the
        UOC-USA, despite Patriarch Mstyslav\u2019s decree to remain independent, clandestinely
        entered into contracts, and understandings with the Greek Patriarchate Church
        of Constantinople (Istanbul, Turkey). Archbishop Antony and his followers
        eventually became hierarchs of the Greek Patriarchate Church and assumed Greek
        Bishop Titles.  The Greek Orthodox Church in Istanbul now claims that the
        UOC-USA is under its jurisdiction and that the diocese is no longer Autocephalous
        [i.e. independent] and all parish properties belong to the bishops. 1994 the
        Hierarchs of the UOC-USA met with the Ecumenical Patriarch in Istanbul, at
        the Patriarch''s invitation, and came to an agreement recognizing the canonicity
        of the Church and accepting the UOC-USA and the entire Ukrainian Orthodox
        Church in the Diaspora into Ecumenical Patriarchate.  Part of the agreement
        also included Protocol 937 between Patriarch Bartholomew of the Ecumenical
        Patriarchate and Patriarch Alexei of the Russian Orthodox Church which detailed
        that the terms of the Russian Church accepting the EP''s absorption of the
        UOCUSA under her omophoron was that the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the USA
        must renounce their autocephaly and not aid the church in Ukraine.<ref>[http://www.bruoc.ca/documents/EasternChurchesJournal-v2-n3%20Protocol%20937.pdf]</ref>\n\nIn

        priests of the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]] and members of the [[Order
        of Saint Basil the Great]], from which they separated.\n\n==History==\n\n===Movement
        within the Basilian order===\nAnthony Elias Dohnal, born 1946, was ordained
        as a priest for the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Litom\u011b\u0159ice]] in
        [[Czechoslovakia]] circa 1971.   After military service, he served as a parochial
        vicar in Slu\u0161ovice and Budi\u0161ov, promoting spiritual revival.  Active
        in the [[Catholic Charismatic Renewal]] since 1981, he fought against the
        tolerance of [[occultism]] and promoted prayer groups.  In 1986 he was assigned
        to a \"prison for nuns\" and kept as a virtual prisoner.  From 1987 to 1990
        he served at [[Dvorce]], continuing with [[samizdat]] writings against liberal
        theology and occultism.  In 1991, together with students R. Spirik and J.
        Spirik, he resolved to join the [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Greek-Catholic]]
        [[Order of Saint Basil the Great]] (OSBM) and entered the [[novitiate]] in
        [[Warsaw]].  In 1992, he transferred to the monastery in [[Trebi\u0161ov]].  Spirik
        and two other former students were ordained priests during 1996-1997.  Shortly
        after, Dohnal applied for permission to found a \"contemplative\" branch of
        the OSBM community.<ref name=uogcc-history/>\n\nIn 1997, Fr. Dionysius Lachovicz
        OSBM (born in [[Brazil]] in 1946),<ref name=inservice/> the General Superior
        of the Basilian order, granted the group permission to be designated as an
        \"experimental community\" within the order under his direct supervision.
        He appointed the group''s leader, Elias Dohnal, OSBM, to direct the formation
        of the novices in the group, men who had been rejected by the order''s novitiate
        in Poland.  In May 1998, after complaints and a canonical visitation, he withdrew
        permission for the community''s special status.  The group appealed to the
        [[Congregation for the Oriental Churches]] for permission to establish an
        autonomous monastery within the territory of the [[Archeparchy of Pre\u0161ov]]
        ([[Slovakia]]) against the will of its bishop, Ivan Hirka.  Lachovicz confirmed
        the suppression in December 1998 and the community members were dispersed

        [[Apostolic Exarchate in the Czech Republic|Apostolic Exarch in the Czech

        of the Roman Catholic [[List of bishops and archbishops of Prague|Archbishop

        in [[Prague]], assigning to it Fr. Cyril \u0160pi\u0159\u00edk, his brother
        Fr. Metod\u011bj R. \u0160pi\u0159\u00edk and their former classmate Fr. Markian
        Hitiuk from Ukraine, to serve at the cathedral parish in [[Prague]].   In
        2003, the Basilians and their supporters protested against the appointment
        of a new Greek-Catholic exarch in the Czech Republic, Ladislav Hu\u010dko,
        a non-Ukrainian, by blockading the Greek-Catholic cathedral.   As a result,
        the event was relocated to be held in a Roman Catholic church.  In 2004, Lachovicz
        was not re-elected.  His successor closed the Order''s community in the Czech
        Republic, transferring the members to the monastery in [[Pidhirtsi]], Ukraine.<ref

        that he and three other Basilian Fathers had been consecrated as bishops in
        order to \"save\" the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church (UGCC) from heresy and
        apostasy. Dohnal did not identify the bishop or bishops who had performed
        the consecration.  In justification for the act, he wrote that the bishops
        of the UGCC supported influences of syncretism and occultism, approval of
        homosexuality, and erroneous ecumenism.  As an example of the latter,  he
        cited the [[Balamand declaration]] of 1993, which had [[Eastern Christianity#Rejection_of_uniatism|rejected
        \"uniatism\"]] as a method of seeking Christian unity between Catholics and
        Orthodox.  In his letter, Dohnal denounced statements from Cardinal Husar''s
        book \"Conversations with Cardinal Lubomyr Husar: On post-confessional Christianity\"
        as schismatic and apostate.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://kyivweekly.com.ua/pulse/society/2011/04/07/181201.html\n|publisher=Kyiv

        on ''''kreuz.net'''', the conflict was \"foreseeable\" and arose from tensions

        including the [[List of Major Archbishops of Kiev\u2013Galicia|Major Archbishop
        of Kiev\u2013Galicia]], [[Lubomyr Husar|Lubomyr Cardinal Husar]], favored
        closer relations with the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, while the Basilians favored
        the preservation of influences from the Latin Church ([[Liturgical latinisation]]).\n\nOn
        Easter Sunday, March 23, 2008, the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]] released
        a statement from Cardinal Husar warning that any consecration that had taken
        place was not recognized by the Church.<ref name=risu20080326/>\n\nIn June
        2008 the [[Ecclesiastical court|tribunal]] of the [[Ukrainian Catholic Eparchy
        of Sokal|Eparchy of Sokal-Zhovkva]] held an ecclesiastical trial for the four
        priests. They were convicted of illegal assumption of authority and illegal
        administration of ministry (violation of can. 1462 of the [[Code of Canons
        of the Eastern Churches]] (CCEO)), inciting rebellion against the local hierarchy,
        including Bishop Mykhail Koltun, [[Redemptorists|C.SS.R.]], Major Archbishop
        [[Lubomyr Husar|Lubomyr Cardinal Husar]] (violation of can. 1447 \u00a71 CCEO),

        persons and to other hierarchs of the UGCC through slander (violation of can.
        1452 CCEO).  The penalty imposed was major [[excommunication]].  After an
        appeal, the sentence was upheld by the tribunal of the major archeparchy and
        announced on September 17, 2008.<ref name=risu20080930/>\n\nOn August 15,
        2008, Pidhirtsi supporters attempted unsuccessfully to occupy a church administration
        building in [[Stryi]], Ukraine.  Fr. Taras Poshyvak, chancellor of the [[Ukrainian

        August 11, 2009, the bishops of the Pidhirtsi movement declared the founding
        of the irregular ''''Ukrainian Orthodox Greek Catholic Church'''' as  a \"new
        Church structure for the orthodox faithful of the UGCC.\" In their declaration
        they professed the Catholic faith, including the primacy of the Roman Pontiff
        and disassociated themselves from \"contemporary heresies which destroy both
        the Eastern and the Western Church.\"<ref name=uogcc-decree/>\n\nThe name

        (\"true-believing\").  Although the Church''s English-language website translates
        this word as \"Orthodox\", it is not the same term as that used by the existing
        [[History of Christianity in Ukraine#Eastern_Orthodox|Orthodox Churches]]

        and advocacy on the side of Moscow during the 2014 pro-European anti-Moscow
        revolution in Ukraine: Before the 1989 collapse of Communism in his homeland,

        services (the infamous KGB). The Ekspress newspaper published what it said
        was a document from former Czechoslovak archives that identified him as a
        mole for Soviet intelligence with the code name \u201cTonek.\u201d The New
        York Times reported that, as of 2014, Mr. Dohnal, who as a Czech national
        has gone into hiding to avoid expulsion from Ukraine for visa violations,
        and his lieutenants never attracted a large number of followers, but  made

        overview and format==\nThe [[2017\u201318 Ukrainian Premier League|2017\u201318]]
        season is the league''s tenth after the restructuring of professional club
        football in 2008 and the 27th season since establishing of professional club''s
        competition independent from the [[Soviet Union]]. As of 2017, [[FC Shakhtar
        Donetsk|Shakhtar Donetsk]] is the reigning Ukrainian Premier League champion.
        To summarise, [[SC Tavriya Simferopol|Tavriya Simferopol]] won the first championship,
        while all the subsequent titles have gone to either [[FC Dynamo Kyiv|Dynamo
        Kyiv]] or [[FC Shakhtar Donetsk|Shakhtar Donetsk]]. Only 3 teams, [[FC Dynamo
        Kyiv|Dynamo Kyiv]], [[FC Shakhtar Donetsk|Shakhtar Donetsk]] and [[FC Dnipro
        Dnipropetrovsk|Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk]] have participated in all previous 26
        Ukrainian Top League competitions. The central feature of the league is a
        game between Dynamo and Shakhtar which is developed into the [[Klasychne derby|Klasychne]]
        (''''Classic'''').\n\nOn 15 April 2008 the new Premier-Liha (''''Premier League'''')
        was formed. The new sports organization consists of 12 football club organizations
        that take control of the league''s operations under the statues of [[Football
        Federation of Ukraine]], [[UEFA]], and [[FIFA]]. With the new reorganization
        the format of the League was preserved, while the changes that were made were
        exclusively administrative. Competitions continued to be conducted in a [[double
        round robin]] format among 16 clubs. There were couple seasons when the 14-clubs
        league''s composition was experimented. Since the 2014 Russian aggression,
        the league was reduced to 12 members, while its format also has changed. The
        season is still being played in a double round robin in the first half of
        a season, after which the league splits in half into two groups of six (6)
        teams. Both the top six and the bottom six play another a double round robin
        tournament with the clubs of own group.\n\nThe teams that reach the top ranks
        of the competition table at the end of each season as always gain the chance
        to represent [[Ukraine]] internationally in several prestigious tournaments
        (continental club tournaments). Also at the end of the season, the bottom
        clubs (usually two) are relegated to the [[Ukrainian First League|First League]]
        (part of the lower [[Professional Football League of Ukraine|Professional
        Football League]]) and replaced by the top clubs from that league. All the
        participants of the Premier League enter the [[Ukrainian Cup|National Cup]]
        competition and enter it at the round of 32 (1/16th of the final) or Round
        of 16 stage. Also the winner of the League at the beginning of every next
        season plays against the winner of the National Cup for the [[Ukrainian Super
        Cup]] (under administration of the Premier League).\n\n===Emblem===\n[[File:Ukrainian
        Premier League.png|thumb|150px|Old emblem]]\nThe old emblem depicts a [[Football
        (association football)|football]] that is wrapped around by the blue-yellow
        stripe (the national colors of [[Ukraine]]) on the blue background. Across
        the top and around the ball there are 16 stars that represent the league''s
        participants (although in 2014 the league was shortened up to 14 teams the
        emblem was not changed). On the bottom the script says \"Premier-League -
        Union of Professional Football Clubs of Ukraine\".\n\n===Season regulations===\nSeason
        regulations is one of the two most important documents (other being the competition
        calendar) that are adopted by the Premier League prior to each season.\n\nPremier
        League directly organizes and conducts competitions among member clubs. Competitions
        are conducted on principle of \"Fair play\" and according to competitions
        calendar which is approved by the Premier League General Assembly and the
        FFU Executive Committee 30 days before start of competitions. Until 2019 all
        advertisement, commercial rights and rights on TV and radio broadcasting of
        games of championship and cup belong to the club that hosts them (except for
        the [[Ukrainian Cup]] final, the Super Cup of Ukraine, and the \"Gold game\").
        All advertisement, commercial rights and rights on TV and radio broadcasting
        of the Ukrainian Cup final belong to the [[Football Federation of Ukraine]],
        while the game of Super Cup and the \"Gold game\" - to the Premier League.\n\nThere
        are currently 12 club members of the league. All participants get approved
        by the Premier League General Assembly. Each club fields each team for senior
        competitions, and competitions for under 21 and under 19 teams (three teams).
        A club is required to have a stadium (registered with FFU) and an education
        and training facility (or center). A club is also obligated to finance its
        own youth sports institution and a complex scientific-methodical group as
        well as to own and finance a number of youth teams. A Premier League club
        needs to ensure participation of at least four youth teams (ages groups between
        14 and 17) in the Youth Football League of Ukraine. A club cannot field more
        than one team for a certain competition.\n\nAll club''s staff members (coaches,
        physicians, massage specialists) have to be contracted and be UEFA licensed.
        All coaches should have A-diploma, while head coaches - PRO-diploma. Football
        players are listed in \"A\" and \"B\" rosters. \"A\" roster contains no more
        than 25 players, while \"B\" roster has unlimited number of players no older
        than 21 who have professional contracts or agreements for sports training.
        The 25-players \"A\" roster includes the number of slots allotted for players
        developed by the club.\n\nDuring breaks in competitions in summer and winter
        there are two periods for registering players.\n\nA championship is conducted
        after the [[Round-robin tournament|round robin]] system in two cycles \"fall-spring\"
        with one game at home and another at opponent''s field with each participant.
        A competition calendar is formed after a draw that is conducted based on the
        Premier League club rankings. The calendar of the second cycle repeats the
        first, while hosting teams are switched. There should be no less than two
        calendar days between official games of a club. All games take place between
        12:00 and 22:00 local time. Any game postponement is allowed only in emergencies
        and on decision of the Premier League Administration (Dyrektsiya). Game forfeitures
        are controlled by technical win/loss nominations and fines, followed by additional
        sanctions of the FFU Control-Disciplinary Committee, and possible elimination
        from the league.\n\n===Competition calendar===\nClubs play each other twice
        (once at home and once away) in the 26-match season. The league begins in
        mid-July and ends in mid-June. After 13 rounds of fixtures, there is a winter
        break that lasts for three months (from early December to early March). Thus,
        the winter break is significantly longer than the interval between seasons.
        This schedule accounts for climatic conditions and matches that of most European
        leagues in terms of the beginning and the end of the season.\n\nThe [[1992
        Ukrainian Premier League|first season]] of the League in 1992 was an exception,
        as it lasted only half a year. This was because the last [[Soviet Top League|Soviet
        league]] season ended in the autumn of 1991, and the [[Football Federation
        of Ukraine]] decided to shift the calendar from \u201cspring-fall\u201d to
        \u201cfall-spring\u201d football seasons. In the inaugural season, 20 clubs
        were divided into two 10-team groups. In both groups, each club played each
        other twice, and the championship was decided by a play-off match between
        the group winners, in which [[SC Tavriya Simferopol|Tavriya Simferopol]] surprised
        the pre-season favorite [[FC Dynamo Kyiv|Dynamo Kyiv]].\n\nAfter the first
        season, in each of the following seasons each team played each other team
        in the League twice. The number of participating teams fluctuated between
        14 and 18, stabilizing since [[2002\u201303 Ukrainian Premier League|2002\u201303
        season]] at 16.\n\nAs of the [[2005\u201306 Ukrainian Premier League|2005\u201306
        season]], the golden match rule was introduced. According to the rule, if
        the first two teams obtain the same number of points, the championship is
        to be decided by an additional \"golden\" match between the two teams. In
        fact, in that season [[FC Dynamo Kyiv|Dynamo Kyiv]] and [[FC Shakhtar Donetsk|Shakhtar
        Donetsk]] had earned the same number of points and Shakhtar won the championship
        by winning the golden match (2&ndash;1 after extra time).\n\n==History==\n{{See
        also|Football in Ukraine|Soviet Top League|Championship of the Ukrainian SSR|Football
        Federation of the Ukrainian SSR}}\n\n===The first decade (1992\u20132000)===\nSince
        the [[fall of the Soviet Union]], the inaugural independent championship took
        place hastily at the start of spring 1992 after the creation of the Ukrainian
        Supreme League ({{lang-uk|\u0412\u0438\u0449\u0430 \u041b\u0456\u0433\u0430}},
        Vyshcha Liha). The League was created out of the six teams that took part
        in the [[Soviet Top League]], two teams from the [[Soviet First League]],
        and nine out of the eleven Ukrainian teams from the [[Soviet Second League]].
        The other two of that eleven were placed in the [[Ukrainian First League]]
        as they were to be relegated anyway. The two best teams of the [[Soviet Second
        League B]] of the ''''Ukrainian Zone'''' were also placed in the Supreme League
        along with the winner of the 1991 Ukrainian Cup which finished ninth in the
        same group (Soviet Second League B).\n\nThe 20 participants were split into
        two groups with the winners playing for the championship title and the runners-up
        playing for third place. Three teams from each group were to be relegated.
        As expected, the five favorites, ''''[[FC Dynamo Kyiv|Dynamo Kyiv]]'''', ''''[[FC
        Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk|Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk]]'''', ''''[[FC Shakhtar Donetsk|Shakhtar
        Donetsk]]'''', ''''[[FC Chornomorets Odesa|Chornomorets Odesa]]'''', and ''''[[FC
        Metalist Kharkiv|Metalist Kharkiv]]'''' finished at the top of each group.
        In the championship play-off game in [[Lviv]], a sensation took place as [[SC
        Tavriya Simferopol|Tavriya Simferopol]] beat [[FC Dynamo Kyiv|Dynamo Kyiv]]
        1\u20130. The Crimeans earned the first Ukrainian title (thus far their only
        one), losing only once to [[FC Temp Shepetivka|Temp Shepetivka]].\n\nAfter
        being stunned in the first championship by the ''''tragedy'''' in [[Lviv]],
        [[FC Dynamo Kyiv|Dynamo Kyiv]] were anxious to earn their first title at the
        second opportunity. In the second Ukrainian championship, which had a regular
        League format of 16 teams, the main rivals of the Kyivians were [[FC Dnipro
        Dnipropetrovsk|Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk]], who were top after the first half
        of the season. By the end of the season both teams were neck and neck and
        at the end they finished with the same number of points. The championship
        title was awarded to [[FC Dynamo Kyiv|Dynamo Kyiv]] as they had a better goal
        difference. Neither the ''''Golden match'''', nor the fact that [[FC Dnipro
        Dnipropetrovsk|Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk]] had a better head-to-head record was
        considered.\n\nThe next seven years were known as the total domination of
        [[FC Dynamo Kyiv|Dynamo Kyiv]]. During this period ''the main Soviet protagonists''
        had changed as some of the best teams were facing a crisis. After the [[1993\u201394
        Ukrainian Premier League|1993\u201394]] season [[FC Metalist Kharkiv|Metalist
        Kharkiv]] were surprisingly relegated to the [[Ukrainian First League|First
        League]]. In the [[1995\u201396 Ukrainian Premier League|1995\u201396]] season
        [[FC Shakhtar Donetsk|Shakhtar Donetsk]] had the worst year in the club''s
        history, coming tenth. [[FC Chornomorets Odesa|Chornomorets Odesa]] were relegated
        twice during that first decade after which manager [[Leonid Buryak]] was sacked.
        A few newly created teams have since emerged such as [[FC Arsenal Kyiv|Arsenal
        Kyiv]] and [[FC Metalurh Donetsk|Metalurh Donetsk]], as well as [[FC Vorskla
        Poltava|Vorskla Poltava]], who surprisingly came third in the club''s first
        season at the Top Level in the [[1996\u201397 Ukrainian Premier League|1997]].\n\n===The
        second decade (2001\u20132010)===\n{{see also|Ukrainian derby}}\nThe next
        decade was marked by fierce competition between [[FC Dynamo Kyiv|Dynamo Kyiv]]
        and [[FC Shakhtar Donetsk|Shakhtar Donetsk]]. Since 2000, [[FC Shakhtar Donetsk|Shakhtar
        Donetsk]] has proved to be the real challengers to Kiev''s dominance. In 2000
        Shakhtar earned their first qualification to the Champions League earning
        a place in the Group stage. Nonetheless, [[FC Dynamo Kyiv|Dynamo Kyiv]] is
        still considered to be the benchmark of excellence in the country and the
        primary feeder to the Ukrainian national football team. 2002 became the real
        cornerstone in the ''''miners'''' history when they earned their first national
        title under the management of the newly appointed Italian specialist, [[Nevio
        Scala]], who managed to secure the [[Ukrainian Cup]] title as well. Since
        that time the issue of foreign players has become particularly acute and brought
        a series of court cases. The [[Football Federation of Ukraine|FFU]] and [[Professional
        Football League of Ukraine|PFL]] worked together to solve that issue, coming
        up with a plan to force the ''''transitional'''' limitation of foreign players
        over time.\n\nThe clubs such as [[FC Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk|Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk]]
        and [[FC Chornomorets Odesa|Chornomorets Odesa]], who were recent contenders
        for the title, had to put up a fierce fight against the newly established
        contenders [[FC Metalurh Donetsk|Metalurh Donetsk]] and [[FC Metalist Kharkiv|Metalist
        Kharkiv]] to qualify for the European competitions. [[FC Metalist Kharkiv|Metalist
        Kharkiv]] shone brightly in the late 2000s (decade) by consistently finishing
        right behind [[FC Dynamo Kyiv|Dynamo Kyiv]] and [[FC Shakhtar Donetsk|Shakhtar
        Donetsk]] in third place. Their most remarkable feat was their participation
        in the 2009 European season when they had to face [[FC Dynamo Kyiv|Dynamo
        Kyiv]] to earn a place in the quarter-finals of the [[2008\u201309 UEFA Cup]],
        but lost on the away goals rule. That same [[2009 UEFA Cup Final|2008\u201309
        UEFA Cup]] competition was won for the first time by [[FC Shakhtar Donetsk|Shakhtar
        Donetsk]], the first club of independent Ukraine to win the title. It was
        also the last UEFA cup title before it changed its name to the Europa league.\n\nIn
        the 2008\u20132009 season the league earned the highest [[UEFA coefficient#Current
        ranking|UEFA league coefficient]] in Europe for that season.\nOn the political
        side of the League it was transformed on 15 April 2008 into an autonomous
        entity, parting away from the PFL. The Premier League has been split since
        the moment it was created in regards to its president. The dispute went as
        far as even canceling the 13th round of [[2009\u201310 Ukrainian Premier League|2009\u201310
        season]] and moving it to the spring half, while having the 14th round still
        playing in the fall. The representatives of five clubs: [[FC Arsenal Kyiv|Arsenal
        Kyiv]], [[FC Dynamo Kyiv|Dynamo Kyiv]], [[FC Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk|Dnipro
        Dnipropetrovsk]], [[FC Kryvbas Kryvyi Rih|Kryvbas Kryvyi Rih]], and [[FC Metalist
        Kharkiv|Metalist Kharkiv]] have been boycotting most of the League meetings,
        not complying with its financial obligations and giving the broadcasting rights
        to TV-channels other than the League official supplier. They justified their
        actions due to what they deem to be the illegal election of the Premier League
        president. The representatives of the above-mentioned clubs did not recognize
        the election in 2008 of [[Vitaliy Danilov]] as the president and believed
        that the elections should have been won by [[Vadim Rabinovich]].\n\nTo resolve
        this conflict [[Vitaliy Danilov]] instigated the re-election of the Premier
        League president in September 2009, and on 1 December 2009 won the election
        again with 11 clubs voting for his candidature, 3 were against, 1 abstained,
        and 1 was absent. This time most club presidents of the Premier League of
        Ukraine acknowledged [[Vitaliy Danilov]] legality. In the subsequent elections
        on 9 December 2011 [[Vitaliy Danilov]] was challenged by Andriy Kurhanskyi
        (through the proposal of [[FC Karpaty Lviv|Karpaty Lviv]]). The other available
        candidates, Miletiy Balchos (president of the Professional Football League
        of Ukraine) and Yuriy Kindzerskyi, were not picked by any members of the Premier
        League. [[Vitaliy Danilov]] managed to retain his seat with nine votes for
        him.\n\n===The third decade (2011\u2013present) ===\nBecause of the [[Ukrainian
        crisis]] in the oblasts of [[Donetsk Oblast|Donetsk]] and [[Luhansk Oblast|Luhansk]]
        the number of teams participating in the league was cut from 16 in the [[2013\u201314

        clubs started to participate in continental competitions. In fact the very
        first Soviet club that took part in European competitions was Ukrainian club,
        [[FC Dynamo Kyiv]], that took in the [[1965\u201366 European Cup Winners''
        Cup]]. Before the [[fall of the Soviet Union]], the following Ukrainian clubs
        participated in European competitions: [[FC Dynamo Kyiv]] (1965), [[FC Karpaty
        Lviv]] (1970), [[FC Zorya Luhansk]] (1973), [[FC Chornomorets Odessa]] (1975),
        [[FC Shakhtar Donetsk]] (1977), [[FC Dnipro]] (1984), and [[FC Metalist Kharkiv]]
        (1988). \n\nAt least four clubs participated in top continental competitions
        the [[European Cup]] and the [[UEFA Champions League]] among which are [[FC
        Dynamo Kyiv]], [[FC Dnipro]], [[FC Shakhtar Donetsk]], and [[FC Metalist Kharkiv]].\n\nTwo
        teams (Dynamo and Shakhtar) were able to obtain trophies of European competitions
        including two [[Cup Winners'' Cup]], one [[UEFA Supercup]], and one [[UEFA
        Cup]]. One more team (Dnipro) came just short to join their company losing

        and city derbies==\n===Klasychne and the championship contenders===\n{{also|Klasychne
        derby}}\nThe central feature of the league is a rivalry between Shakhtar Donetsk
        and Dynamo Kyiv which has adopted its name as Klasychne. The rivalry started
        ever since the end of 1990s when both teams started consistently to place
        the top two places from season to season. The rivalry became really established
        when Shakhtar obtained its first national title in 2002. \n\nThe surprising
        win of the first season by [[SC Tavriya Simferopol]] has never turned the
        club into a real contender for another title and the club was not always successful
        to secure a place among the top five. In the beginning of 1990s [[FC Chornomorets
        Odessa]] and the Soviet champions [[FC Dnipro]] were also among the main contenders.
        The Soviet 1972 champions [[FC Zorya Luhansk]] until 2013 really struggled
        to stay in the top league. Among other contenders there were [[FC Metalist
        Kharkiv]] that were the league''s runners-up in 2012-13 and [[FC Metalurh
        Donetsk]] that showed some consistent form in the early 2000s.\n\n===Other
        rivalries===\nThere are few smaller regional rivalries such between Karpaty
        and Volyn, Metalist and Dnipro, Zorya and Shakhtar.\n\nAmong city derbies,
        there are no running city derbies in the league for the 2017-18 season. Among
        the most notable previously there were Zaporizhian derby between Metalurh
        and Torpedo, Kyivan derby &ndash; Dynamo and Arsenal (CSKA), Donetsk derby
        &ndash; Shakhtar and Metalurh. Other derbies existed in Lviv, Odesa, Kharkiv,
        others.\n\n==Stadiums==\n{{more|List of football stadiums in Ukraine}}\nUkraine
        has several big stadiums with capacity of 30,000+ spectators and at least
        two stadiums with capacity of over 50,000 which also are considered to be
        by UEFA the elite stadiums. Since the 2014 Russian invasion and partial occupation
        of Ukraine, the access to some stadiums was restricted. Many stadiums in Ukraine
        and their surrounding infrastructure were renovated in preparation to the
        [[Euro 2012]].\n\n===UEFA Elite Stadiums===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!#!!Stadium!!Capacity!!City!!Club!!Opened\n|-\n|-\n|

        [[football (soccer)|football]] [[reserve team]], the parent clubs of which
        compete in the [[Ukrainian Premier League]].\n\n== History ==\nThe League
        was established in 2004 for the 2004\u201305 season. It is a development league
        and therefore its participants'' performance does not result in the team''s
        relegation from the Ukrainian Premier Reserve League. The relegation occurs
        only based on their final league position of their respective senior teams
        in the [[Ukrainian Premier League]]. If the senior team is relegated from
        the Ukrainian Premier League, then its reserve team is relegated from the
        Premier Reserve League and replaced by a reserve team of another newly promoted
        club from the [[Ukrainian First League]].\n\nPremier League junior (U19) championship
        already existed in 2002&ndash;2006.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20170708204924/https://www.footboom.com/ukrainian/tournament-u-19/1474527587-v-ukraini-startuvav-chempionat-yunioriv-u-19-z-komandamy-pfl.html

        [[socialism]], increased rights for Ukrainian [[peasants]], and [[secularism]].\n\n==Programme
        and Ideology==\n\n[[Image:Drahomanov mykhajlo.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Mykhailo
        Drahomanov, whose political ideas formed the basis of the Ukrainian Radical
        Party''s ideology]]\n\nThe Radical Party ideology was based on the political
        thought of [[Mykhailo Drahomanov]], an eastern Ukrainian thinker who spent
        part of the nineteenth century in western Ukraine.  Although the Radical party
        advocated socialism in its ideology, it considered itself different from western
        socialists who were beholden to the ideas of [[Karl Marx]] because western
        socialism was based on the industrial [[proletariat]] while the Radical party
        was focused on the peasantry.  Accordingly, its socialism was [[agrarian socialism|agrarian
        and peasant-based]].  The Ukrainian Radical party claimed kinship and affinity
        with the similarly peasant-based socialist [[People''s Radical Party|Serbian
        Radical Party]] of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.<ref

        It actively opposed the influence of the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]]
        and [[Western Ukrainian clergy|its priests]] in Ukrainian society. It was
        also opposed to the [[Cisleithania|Austria]]n government, to mainstream Ukrainophiles
        who were loyal to Austria, and to Ukrainian attempts to cooperate with Polish
        authorities.  At the same time, the URP cooperated with Polish workers and
        peasants.<ref>[[Orest Subtelny]]. (1988). ''''Ukraine: A History''''. Toronto:
        University of Toronto Press, pg. 328</ref> The URP supported Ukrainian independence
        at a party congress in 1895, the first time that the goal of an independent

        (1996). ''''A History of Ukraine''''. Toronto: University of Toronto Press,
        pg. 446</ref> Involved with the plight of the Ukrainian peasants, the URP
        also called for and organized [[strike action|strike]]s of Ukrainian agricultural
        workers.\n\n==History==\n\nThe Radical Party was founded in [[Lviv]] on October
        4, 1890 by a group of Ukrainian activists including the poet [[Ivan Franko]],
        the publisher Mykhailo Pavlyk, and others. It was involved in founding reading
        rooms and cooperatives, organizing women''s groups, and training and politicizing
        Ukrainian peasants.  In 1895, the party passed a resolution calling for Ukrainian
        independence.  That same year, it sent three representatives to the Galician
        [[Diet (assembly)|Diet]] and in 1897 two representatives to the [[Austria\u2013Hungary|Austrian]]
        [[Reichsrat (Austria)|parliament]].<ref name = \"encyclopediaURP\"/>\n\nIn
        the mid-1890s three competing groups emerged within the URP.  One maintained
        its allegiance to the traditional ideology of the URP.  Another faction turned
        more to western European [[socialism]] and [[Marxism]].  A third faction which
        included most of the Radical Party''s most prominent members such as [[Ivan
        Franko]] became increasingly disenchanted with socialist ideas and more focussed
        on national concerns.  In 1899 the latter two groups left the Radical Party.  The
        socialist-learning faction splitt of to form the [[Ukrainian Social Democratic
        Party (1899)|Ukrainian Social Democratic Party]].  The nationalist-leading
        faction merged with mainstream Ukrainiphiles to create the National Democratic
        Party, which was the largest Ukrainian political party in Austrian-ruled Ukraine
        before and during the [[World War I|first world war]].  The National Democratic
        party, renamed the [[Ukrainian National Democratic Alliance]], would continue
        to dominate western Ukrainian political life until the Second World War.\n\nAfter
        the exodus of the Ukrainian Social Democrats and the National Democrats, the
        remaining Ukrainian Radical Party, having become a definitively peasant-oriented
        party, was the second largest political party among ethnic Ukrainians in western
        Ukraine.<ref name = \"encyclopediaURP\"/> In 1911, it sent five members to
        the Austrian parliament and in 1913 six members to the Galician Diet. On the
        eve of World War I, the Radical party established sporting societies and paramilitary
        groups that would serve as the basis for the [[Ukrainian Sich Riflemen]],
        an all-Ukrainian unit within the Austrian army.<ref name = \"encyclopediaURP\"/>\n\nThe
        Ukrainian Radical Party was one of the founding parties of the [[West Ukrainian
        National Republic]], and its members occupied the posts of defence minister
        ([[Dmytro Vitovsky]]) and interior secretary within the West Ukrainian government.<ref
        name = \"encyclopediaURP\"/>   Following the war, when western Ukraine became
        part of the [[Second Polish Republic|Polish state]], at a party congress in
        1925 the Radical Party passed a resolution simultaneously opposing cooperation
        with Ukrainian \"bourgeois parties\" and condemning [[Ukrainian Bolsheviks|Bolsheviks]]
        policies in [[Soviet Ukraine]]. A year later, it merged with a socialist party
        and renamed itself the ''''''Ukrainian Socialist Radical Party'''''' (USRP).  In
        the [[1928 Polish elections]], the party received 280,000 votes, the second
        most among western Ukrainian parties following the [[Ukrainian National Democratic
        Alliance]]''s 600,000 votes.<ref name= \"Subtelny\">[[Orest Subtelny]]. (1988).
        ''''Ukraine: a History.'''' Toronto: University of Toronto Press, pp. 434-441</ref>
        This enabled the USRP to send 11 representatives into the [[Polish parliament|parliament]]
        and 3 into the [[Polish senate|senate]]. In the [[1931 Polish elections|1931
        elections]] it ran in a coalition with the [[Ukrainian National Democratic
        Alliance]] and obtained 1/4 of the coalition''s seats. The USRP boycotted
        all subsequent Polish elections.<ref name = \"encyclopediaURP\"/>\n\nThe party
        was a member of the [[Labour and Socialist International]] between 1931 and
        1940.<ref>Kowalski, Werner. ''''[https://books.google.com/books?id=83QdPwAACAAJ

        of Western Ukraine, 1939\u20131940|Soviets annexed western Ukrainian territory]]
        in 1939, the USRP like all other western Ukrainian political parties was forced

        structure==\n[[File:Ukrainian Railways (subdivisions).png|thumb|270px|Subdivisions
        of Ukrainian Railways]]\nThe railways are split into six territorial railway
        companies: Donetsk, [[Lviv Railways|Lviv]], Odesa, [[Southern Railways (Ukraine)|Southern]],
        [[Southwestern Railways|South-Western]] and Near-Dnipro. The subdivision is
        purely administrative as it doesn''t correspond to the particular railway
        lines or branches. The names of regional railways are purely historic, inherited
        from the [[Russian Empire|Russian]] and [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]]s. For
        instance, the ''South-Western Railway'' actually operates the ''north-central''
        part of Ukraine''s rail network. The ''Southern Railway'' actually operates
        in the east of the country, whilst the Near-Dnipro Railways are the southernmost.\n[[File:Ukraine

        \u2013 [[Kiev]]\n# [[Near-Dnipro Railway]] \u2013 [[Dnipropetrovsk|Dnipro]]\n\nThe
        territorial railways are further divided into several territorial administrations,
        usually four or five. Such division helps in assignment of commuter railway
        lines depending on location.\n\n===Financial situation===\nIn 2008 the Ukrainian
        State Railways transported around 498.5&nbsp;million tonnes of domestic freight
        and 69.8&nbsp;million tonnes of international freight in transit through Ukrainian
        territory; freight transport figures were particularly high on transport Routes
        3, 5 and 9, which saw a combined total of 105 million tonnes carried in 2008.
        Further to this, Ukrzaliznytsia served around 518.8&nbsp;million passengers
        over the course of the year. The state railways ran with an annual consolidated
        budget of a little more than 40&nbsp;billion \u20b4 (US$5&nbsp;billion) in
        2008.\n\nBy the end of 2005 the railways had produced a profit equivalent
        to 1.76&nbsp;billion \u20b4 (US$220&nbsp;million) from all their operations
        including freight, passenger service, associated services and the operation
        of subsidiaries. The total capital invested in fixed assets of the State Railways
        is thought to be equivalent to around 22&nbsp;billion \u20b4 (US$4.4&nbsp;billion),
        however, depreciation of these fixed assets is estimated to be around 57%,
        or in terms of rolling stock, closer to 66.7%.\n\n===Ranks===\n{|  style=\"width:75%;

        27 April 2011 in accordance with order \u2116 504/2011 rail industry specialists

        development of a new classification system for passenger trains in Ukraine
        was made necessary by the need to inform customers (passengers) about the
        level of service quality they could expect to find in various passenger trains.
        The new system is based on the class of train and carriages.\n\nGiven the
        quality of the service provided UZ asked the following classes of passenger
        trains:\n\n*Daytime passenger lines:\n**''''''Euro City (EC)'''''' \u2013
        Express (min. 90&nbsp;km/h) daytime services on international routes which
        should offer a very high level of service and comfort. First and standard
        classes.\n**''''''Inter City+ (IC+)'''''' \u2013 Express (min. 90&nbsp;km/h)
        daytime services on domestic routes which should offer a very high level of
        service and comfort. First and standard classes. These services are currently
        operated by [[Hyundai Rotem]] [[HRCS2 multiple unit]] trains on routes between
        [[Kiev]] and [[Kharkiv]], [[Lviv]], [[Dnipropetrovsk|Dnipro]] and [[Donetsk]].\n**''''''Inter
        City (IC)'''''' \u2013 (max. 70&nbsp;km/h \u2013 90&nbsp;km/h) daytime services
        on domestic routes which should offer a heightened level of service and comfort.
        First, standard and economy classes. These services are currently operated
        by [[\u0160koda Works|\u0160koda]] [[\u010cD Class 471|UZ class 675]] trains
        on routes between [[Kharkiv]], [[Dnipropetrovsk|Dnipro]] and [[Donetsk]].\n**''''''Regional
        Express (\u0420\u0415)'''''' \u2013 (max. 70&nbsp;km/h \u2013 90&nbsp;km/h)
        daytime services on domestic routes which should offer a standard level of
        service and comfort. First, standard and economy classes.\n**''''''Regional

        domestic routes which should offer a standard level of service and comfort.
        Standard and economy classes.\n*Nighttime passenger trains:\n**''''''Euro
        Night (EN)'''''' \u2013 Express (min. 90&nbsp;km/h) nighttime services on
        international routes which should offer a very high level of service and comfort.
        [[Sleeping car|2 berth coupe]] and 4 berth coupe classes.\n**''''''Night Express
        (\u041d\u0415)'''''' (max. 70&nbsp;km/h \u2013 90&nbsp;km/h) nighttime services
        on international and domestic routes which should offer a heightened level
        of service and comfort.  [[Sleeping car|2 berth coupe]], 4 berth coupe and
        [[Couchette car|platskarta]] classes.\n**''''''Night fast (\u041d\u0428)''''''
        \u2013 (max. 50&nbsp;km/h \u2013 70&nbsp;km/h) nighttime services on international
        and domestic routes which should offer a heightened level of service and comfort.
        [[Sleeping car|2 berth coupe]], 4 berth coupe and [[Couchette car|platskarta]]
        classes.\n**''''''Night passenger (\u041d\u041f)'''''' (max. 50&nbsp;km/h)
        nighttime services on international and domestic routes which should offer
        a heightened level of service and comfort. [[Sleeping car|4 berth coupe]]
        and [[Couchette car|platskarta]] classes.\n\nThe advantages of the new classification
        system include: full compliance with the classification of the European Union,
        compliance with Ukrainian and English names and abbreviations, clarity for
        customers, linguistic and semantic consistency and clarity for customers in
        Ukraine and compatibility with existing and future tariff policy. The system
        is also not far displaced from the previous classification system used for
        passenger trains on the territory of Ukraine and therefore should not cause
        major problems when introduced.\n\n==Gallery==\n<center>\n<gallery caption=\"Rolling

        history==\nThe Ukrainian Red Cross Society was established in April, 1918
        in [[Kiev]] as an independent humanitarian society of the [[Ukrainian People''s
        Republic]]. Its immediate tasks were to help [[refugees]] and prisoners of
        war, care of handicapped people, [[orphan]]ed children, fighting famine and
        epidemics, support and organize sick quarters, [[hospital]]s and public canteens.\n\nFrom
        the 1920s, when Ukrainian territory was integrated part of the Soviet Union,
        and until 1992, the Ukrainian Red Cross functioned as a part of the Soviet
        Red Cross.\n\n==During World War II==\n\nWhen the structure of the [[Ukrainian
        Insurgent Army|UPA]] was unified in 1943, the Ukrainian Red Cross was re-established
        as a separate body from the Soviet Red Cross. The service provided care for
        the sick and wounded UPA soldiers, attracted well-qualified doctors, prepared
        the supply and manufacture of medicine, equipped underground hospitals and
        conducted training classes for new physicians and soldiers of the UPA and
        prepared special medical manuals. Doctors worked in regional military hospitals
        which treated the wounded who had suffered from the attacks of German, Soviet
        or Polish punitive groups.\n\n==Present time==\n[[File:Ukrainian Red Cross

        Events of Jan 19, 2014-5.jpg|thumb|Volunteers administering first aid to a
        wounded [[Euromaidan]] protester.]]\nThe Red Cross law was passed by the [[Verkhovna
        Rada|Ukrainian parliament]] in 1999.\n\nAt present, the Ukrainian Red Cross
        involves more than 6.3 million of supporters and activists. Its Visiting Nurses
        Service has 3200 qualified [[nurse]]s. The organization takes part in more
        than 40 humanitarian programmes all over [[Ukraine]], which are mostly funded
        by public donation and corporate partnerships. By its own estimations, the
        Society annually provides services to more than 105 000 of lonely elderly
        people, about 23 000 of people disabled during the Second World War and handicapped
        workers, more than 25 000 of war veterans, and more than 8 000 of adults handicapped
        since childhood. The assistance for [[orphan]]ed and disabled children is
        also rendered.<ref>''''\"\u0427\u0435\u0440\u0432\u043e\u043d\u0438\u0439

        2013}}\n{{no footnotes|date=February 2013}}\nThe ''''''Ukrainian Republic
        Capella'''''' (later known as the ''''''Ukrainian National Chorus'''''') was
        a musical company during and after World War I which toured Europe and North
        America with the intent to promote Ukrainian culture abroad. The main sponsor
        of the Capella was [[Symon Petlura]].\n\n==Background==\nDuring [[World War
        I]], many events shook [[Eastern Europe]]. In [[Ukraine]], a new chance to
        create an independent state presented itself. One of the key figures in this
        period was [[Symon Petlura]]. Petlura thought that many people may want to
        contribute to the promotion of [[Ukrainian culture]], and realized that not
        everybody would be a good soldier. In order to include the greatest number
        of people into the process of statehood, Petlura organized a series of cultural
        programs, funded by the central [[Directorate of Ukraine]], to actively promote
        Ukrainian culture abroad. One such initiative was the Ukrainian Republic Capella.\n\n==Beginning==\nIn
        January 1919, Petlura held a meeting with [[Oleksander Koshetz]] and [[Kyrylo
        Stetsenko]] and presented the idea. Soon after this meeting, Oleksa Prykhodko
        also joined the Capella as assistant director.\n\nThe situation of the Capella
        was difficult in that the political situation in [[Kiev]] was unstable. Although
        Koshetz and Stetsenko began work almost immediately, on January 26, 1919,
        Koshetz was forced to leave Kiev before it was overrun by the [[bolsheviks]].\n\nThe
        Capella eventually reunited in [[Kamyanets-Podilsky]], where the final preparations
        were made.\n\n==First European Tour==\nThe first tour of the Ukrainian Republic
        Capella started on April 26, 1919 in [[Czechoslovakia]]. The first concert
        was performed  on May 20, 1919. \n\nThe tour continued from Czechoslovakia
        to [[Switzerland]], [[France]], [[Belgium]], the [[Netherlands]], and [[England]].\n\n==Second
        European Tour==\nEven though the Capella as a choir was receiving triumphant
        reviews, personality conflicts between Koshetz and Prykhodko led to a split.
        In the fall of 1920, Prykhodko and 20 members of the Capella returned to Czechoslovakia.\nHowever,
        Koshetz received further funding from Petlura, and Koshetz recruited [[History
        of the Ukrainian minority in Poland|Ukrainians]] living in [[Second Polish
        Republic|Poland]] to the Capella.\n\nThe new Capella toured France, [[Spain]],
        and Belgium.\n\n==Dissolution==\nIn May 1921, Oleksander Koshetz announced
        the dissolution of the Ukrainian Republic Capella.\n\nLater that year, Koshetz
        and some other members of the Capella created the Ukrainian National Chorus.
        \n\n==Legacy==\nThe Ukrainian National Chorus, which toured the United States
        and Canada between 1922 and 1926 is credited with introducing the Ukrainian
        Christmas Carol \"Shchedryk\" - known as the \"[[Carol of the Bells]]\" in
        English<!-- The following needs a reference, and one much better than Alexis
        Kochan''s off the record remark in a Ukrainian newspaper article: , and also

        Yu. Lytvyn, O. Tykhyi, V. Marchenko) died in Soviet camps.\n\nMarch 1988 -
        Ukrainian Helsinki Union (UKhS) was formed. Since 1989, UKhS has moved to
        open propaganda activity of promoting the independence of Ukraine.\n\nApril

        place of the UKhS. The party was registered on November 5, 1990 by the Ministry
        of Justice of the [[Ukrainian SSR]] as the first political party in Ukraine.\n\nA
        1992 split in the party resulted in the creation of the rival [[Ukrainian

        the [[Tsardom of Russia]], architecture in Ukraine began to develop in different
        directions, with many structures in the larger eastern, Russian-ruled area
        built in the styles of [[Russian architecture]] of that period, whilst the

        of [[Kievan Rus'']] was the predecessor of modern states of [[Ukraine]], [[Russia]],
        and [[Belarus]] and their respective cultures, including architecture.\n\nThe
        great [[Architecture of Kievan Rus''|Church architecture]], built after the
        [[Baptism of Kievan Rus''|adoption of Christianity]] in 988, were the first
        examples of monumental architecture in the East Slavic lands. The architectural
        style of the Kievan state, which quickly established itself, was strongly
        influenced by the [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine]]. Early [[Eastern Orthodox]]
        churches were mainly made of wood, with the simplest form of church becoming
        known as a [[cell church]]. Major cathedrals often featured scores of small
        domes, which led some art historians to take this as an indication of the
        appearance of pre-Christian pagan Slavic temples.\n\nSeveral examples of these
        churches survive to this day. However, in the course of the 16th\u201318th
        centuries, many were externally rebuilt in the [[Ukrainian Baroque]] style
        (see below). Examples include the grand [[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kiev|St.

        laid, [[Church of the Saviour at Berestove]] \u2013 built from 1113 to 1125,
        and the [[St. Cyril''s Monastery|St. Cyril''s Church]], c. 12th century. All
        can still be found in the Ukrainian capital.\n\nSeveral buildings were reconstructed
        during the late 19th century, including the [[:File:WladimirWolynsk Uspenski
        Cathedral.jpeg|Assumption Cathedral]] in [[Volodymyr-Volynskyi]], built in

        built in 1037 and reconstructed in 1982. The latter''s reconstruction was
        dismissed by some art and architecture historians as a revivalist fantasy.\n\nLittle

        integrated into the [[Russian Empire]], Russian architects had the opportunity
        to realize their projects in the picturesque landscape that many Ukrainian
        cities and regions offered. [[St. Andrew''s Church of Kiev]] (1747\u20131754),
        built by [[Bartolomeo Rastrelli]], is a notable example of [[Baroque]] architecture,
        and its location on top of the Kievan mountain made it a recognizable monument
        of the city. An equally notable contribution of Rasetrelli was the [[Mariyinsky
        Palace]], which was built to be a summer residence to Russian Empress [[Elizabeth
        of Russia|Elizabeth]].\n\nDuring the reign of the last [[Hetman of Ukraine]],
        [[Kirill Razumovsky]], many of the [[Cossack Hetmanate]]''s towns such as
        [[Hlukhiv]], [[Baturyn]] and [[Koselets]] had grandiose projects built by
        the appointed ''''architect of [[Little Russia]],'''' [[Andrey Kvasov]].\n\nRussia,
        winning successive wars over the [[Ottoman Empire]] and its vassal [[Crimean
        Khanate]], eventually annexed the whole south of Ukraine and Crimea. Renamed
        [[New Russia]], these lands were to be colonized, and new cities such as the
        [[Mykolayiv|Nikolayev]], [[Odessa]], [[Kherson]] and [[Sevastopol]] were founded.
        These would contain notable examples of Imperial Russian architecture.\n{{clear}}\n\n==
        Vernacular Architecture ==\nThe term ''''[[vernacular architecture]]'''' can
        been used interchangeably with the terms ''''folk'''', ''''common'''', ''''native'''',
        ''''traditional'''' and is usually placed at the other end of the spectrum
        from professionally designed building by architects. The building knowledge
        in vernacular architecture is based on local traditions and is thus based
        largely upon knowledge handed down through the generations. Different regions
        in Ukraine had their own distinctive style of vernacular architecture. For
        example, in the [[Carpathian Mountains]] and the surrounding [[foothills]],
        wood and clay are the primary traditional building materials.\n\nThe Museum
        of Folk Architecture and Way of Life of Central [[Naddnipryanshchyna]] is
        located in [[Pereiaslav-Khmelnytskyi]]. The open-air museum contains 13 theme
        museums, 122 examples of national architecture, and over 30,000 historical
        cultural objects. The Museum of Decorative Finishes is one of the featured
        museums that preserves the handiwork of decorative architectural applications
        in Ukrainian architecture.\n{{Gallery\n|title=\n|width=200 | height=210 |

        the [[October Revolution]] and the [[Russian Civil War]] that [[Ukraine after
        Russian Revolution|Ukraine was also involved in]], most of the Ukrainian territory
        was incorporated into the new Communist [[Ukrainian SSR]]. For the first time,
        Ukrainians, as a nation became a recognized nationality, and as a result great
        efforts were undertaken to develop a separate Ukrainian architectural style.\n\n===
        Capital: Kharkiv (1917\u20131934) ===\n\n[[Image:Kharkov Freedom Square.jpg|thumb|225px|The
        massive [[Freedom Square, Kharkiv|Freedom square in Kharkiv]] 1925\u20131953
        blends early constructivist and latter [[Stalinist architecture|Stalinist
        features]]. It was the first major architectural project of [[Soviet Ukraine]].]]\n\nDuring
        the early years of the Soviet rule, the [[Ukrainization]] policies, meant
        that many Ukrainian architects were encouraged to use national motives unique
        to Ukraine. At the same time, architecture became standardised, all cities
        received general development plans to which they would be built. The national
        motives were, however, not taken up as the new architectural fashion for the
        new government became [[Constructivist architecture|Constructivism]].\n\nIn
        Soviet Ukraine, for the first 15 years, the capital was the eastern city of
        [[Kharkiv]]. Immediately a major project was developed to \"destroy\" its
        burgious-capitalist face and create a new Socialist one. A talented young
        architect [[Viktor Trotsenko]], proposed a large central square with large
        modern buildings to become the central hub of the capital. Thus the [[Freedom
        Square, Kharkiv|Dzerzhinsky Square]] (now Freedom Square) was born, which
        would become the most brilliant example of constructivist architecture in
        the USSR and abroad. Enclosing a total of 11.6 [[hectares|ha]],<ref>{{ru icon}}
        [http://www.kharkov.com/news/?p=25 \"Our Kharkiv\"] unofficial website</ref>
        it is currently the third largest square in the world to date.\n\nOf all,
        the most famous was the massive [[Gosprom]] building (1925\u20131928), which
        would become a symbol of not only Kharkiv, but Constructivism in general.
        Built by architects Sergei Serafimov, S. Kravets and M. Felger, and only in
        three years it would become the highest structure in Europe, and its unique
        feature lies in the symmetry which can only be felt at one point, in the centre
        of the square. As a tribute to the engineering design by Kharkiv''s Technical
        University, none of the attempts to blow the building during the [[World War
        II|Second World War]] were successful, and it still remains the symbol of
        Kharkiv today.\n\nOther examples on the square, however, were less fortunate.
        Such was the fate of the House of Projects (presently the [[Kharkiv University]]),
        which again was designed by Serafimov, built to symmetrise the Gosprom on
        the square''s curvature, it too was a monumental achievement of constructivism.
        However, during the war it was seriously damaged and was rebuilt in a semi-Stalinist
        style that left little of the original building intact.<ref>[http://www.kharkov.ua/culture/2b.html

        was constructed (''''pictured'''').]]\n\nIn 1934, the capital of Soviet Ukraine
        moved to [[Kiev]]. During the preceding years, the city was seen as only a
        regional centre, and hence received little attention. All of that was to change,
        but at a great price. By this point, the first examples of [[Stalinist architecture]]
        were already showing and in light of the official policy, a new city was to
        be built on top of the old one. This meant that priceless examples such as
        the [[St. Michael''s Golden-Domed Monastery]] were destroyed. Even the St.
        Sophia Cathedral was under threat.\n\nHowever, the [[World War II|Second World
        War]] did not see the project realised. The surviving pre-war Kievan constructions
        include the Building of the Central Committee of the [[Communist Party of
        Ukraine]] (presently occupied by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs). Built by
        architect, only the northern wing was completed, the identical and symmetrical
        southern wing to be built on the place of the destroyed monastery to house
        the Rada of Ministers was never completed.<ref>{{cite book | first=Titus D.

        total of individual 22 projects were drawn up, when the initial competition
        began in 1944, none of which was realised due to extensive critique and finally
        in 1948 ''''KyivProekt'''' institute submitted its final version, headed by
        architects A. Vlasov and from 1949 [[Anatoly Dobrovolsky]]. For the next two
        decades, this figure would dominate all of the major projects in the capital.\n\n{{Gallery|title=Central

        the new politics of architecture once again promptly stopped the project from
        fully being realised. None of the examples, however, share the fate of [[Hotel
        Ukrayina]] that was to top the square as an elegant  high-rise built similar
        to the [[Seven Sisters (Moscow)|Moscow''s Seven Sisters]] buildings, was stripped

        language of modern architecture becomes more global and pluralistic in its
        artistic direction. At the same time, a significant role play new creative
        quests of progressive leanings, principles and approaches to solve the composition
        of the architectural form and style.\n\nIn the works of the Kiev school of
        Ukrainian architects, [[Postmodern architecture|postmodernism]] and [[High-tech
        architecture|high-tech]] tendencies can be increasingly found. This is a reflection
        of the globalization''s reach across the world of architecture.\n\nThe task
        for modern Ukrainian architecture is diverse application of modern aesthetics,
        the search for an architect''s own artistic style and inclusion of the existing
        historico-cultural environment.\n\nGood examples of modern Ukrainian architecture
        include the reconstruction and renewal of the [[Maidan Nezalezhnosti]] in
        central Kiev, despite the limit set by narrow space within the plaza, the
        engineers were able to blend together the uneven landscape and also use underground
        space to set a new shopping centre.\n\nThe major project that will take up
        most of the 21st century, is the construction of the Kiev City-Centre on the
        [[Rybalskyi Peninsula]], which, when finished, will include a dense [[skyscraper]]

        Kiev 2010 01.jpg|thumb|[[Zoloti Vorota (Kiev Metro)]]]]\nDuring the Soviet
        Period, [[Rapid transit|Metro]] stations were decorated with particularly
        vivid designs. The first three stations that were built by Ukrainian architects,
        were not actually located in Ukraine. Nonetheless, all three of them are considered
        to be the most iconic constructions ever achieved in history of underground
        construction. They are all known under one name Kievskaya, and are located
        on the [[Moscow Metro]] under the [[Kiyevsky Rail Terminal]].\n\nIn 1949 construction
        began on the first stage of the [[Kiev Metro]], which opened in 1960. All
        of the stations there are considered as monuments of architecture, due to
        their unique authentic character, that latter stations of the 1960s would
        lose in face of changing policy towards utilitarianism.\n\n<!-- Image with

        semi-Metro [[Kryvyi Rih Metrotram]] in 1986 and the [[Dnipropetrovsk Metro]]
        in 1995. Stations built in these systems, like most others in the former Soviet

        seven wonders of Ukraine were announced. The initiator of this project is
        the people''s representative to Supreme Council, [[Mykola Tomenko]]. The main
        goal of this enterprise is to direct the attention of the mass media and the
        citizens of the country to the most popular historical and cultural memorials
        of Ukraine.\n\nThe ''''seven wonders of Ukraine'''' is a logical extension
        of the set of projects under the motto ''''Discover Ukraine!'''' that have
        taken place with the purpose to help discover Ukraine with its irreplaceable
        scenic sights, an interesting history, and rich recreational opportunities.\n\nIn
        2008, another project took place under the name ''''Seven natural wonders
        of Ukraine''''. It is a second stage of the main project ''''Seven wonders
        of Ukraine'''' which was primarily aimed at historical, cultural, and architectural
        sightings of the country. The second stage will identify the main geological
        objects such as rocks, mountain ridges, caves, lakes, rivers, natural woodlands.\n\nThis
        project as its predecessor also has three stages. First, after each Oblast
        introduces its nominees, 100 of those will move to the next stage. In the
        next three months, 21 winners of those hundred will be chosen for the final
        stage. And by the Independence Day, August 24, the final seven will be introduced
        to the public. The project is organized by the following institutions: the
        National Touristic Service of Ukraine, the Congressional Committee of youth
        policies, sport, and tourism, the national radio company of Ukraine, the ICTV
        telecompany, magazine ''''Mandry'''', and many others.\n\n== See also ==\n\n*

        Ukrainian crisis}}\n\nA prolonged ''''''crisis in [[Ukraine]]'''''' began
        on 21 November 2013, when then-president [[Viktor Yanukovych]] suspended preparations
        for the implementation of [[Ukraine\u2013European Union Association Agreement|an
        association agreement]] with the [[European Union]]. This decision resulted
        in mass protests by its proponents, known as the \"[[Euromaidan]]\". After
        months of such protests, Yanukovych [[2014 Ukrainian revolution|was ousted]]
        by the protesters on 22 February 2014, when he fled the Ukrainian capital
        city of [[Kiev]]. Following his ousting, [[2014 pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine|unrest
        enveloped]] the largely [[Russian language in Ukraine|Russophone]] [[Eastern
        Ukraine|eastern]] and [[Southern Ukraine|southern]] regions of Ukraine, from
        where he had drawn most of his support. An ensuing political crisis and [[Russian
        military intervention in Ukraine (2014\u2013present)|Russian military intervention]]
        in the [[Autonomous Republic of Crimea|Ukrainian autonomous region]] of [[Crimea]]
        resulted in the [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|annexation
        of Crimea by Russia]] on 18 March 2014. Subsequently, unrest in [[Donetsk
        Oblast|Donetsk]] and [[Luhansk Oblast|Luhansk]] oblasts of Ukraine evolved
        into a [[war in Donbass]] between the post-revolutionary Ukrainian government
        and pro-Russian insurgents, supported and often assisted by the Russian military
        and special forces.\n\n==Euromaidan and revolution==\n{{main article|Euromaidan|2014

        ship was laid down in 1983 and launched in 1990 just before the fall of the
        Soviet Union. Due to budget constraints work on the cruiser stopped in the
        early 1990s and the ship was left unfinished. In 1993 the cruiser was withdrawn
        from the [[Russian Navy]] and passed to [[Ukraine]]. In 1997 Ukraine stated
        that it had no need for the cruiser and was willing to sell it. Russia was
        unwilling to buy the cruiser, China and India were then approached but showed
        no interest at the time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kommersant.com/p-10051/r_500/missile_cruiser_sell_/|title=Russia,

        at the harbor of [[Mykolaiv]] in southern Ukraine.\n\nIn April 2010, sources
        from the Russian defense committee claimed that Russia had plans to buy the
        unfinished cruiser from Ukraine and in May 2010, after talks with Russian
        president [[Dmitry Medvedev]] in [[Kiev]], Ukrainian president [[Viktor Yanukovych]]
        stated that they had come to an agreement to finish the ship together.<ref>{{cite

        Russian navy sources stated that Russia was only interested in obtaining the
        cruiser if they can have it free of charge. By early March 2011, Russian defence
        minister Anatoly Serdiukov stated that Russia was still waiting for an acceptable
        offer from Ukraine, regarding potential procurement of the missile cruiser.
        His Ukrainian counterpart Mikhail Yezhel responded that he would not scrap
        a 95% complete warship, and that the issue would be resolved in the near future.<ref>{{cite

        ''''''grammar of the [[Ukrainian language]]'''''' describes the phonological,
        morphological, and syntactical rules of the Ukrainian language. Ukrainian
        contains 7 cases and 2 numbers for its nominal declension and 2 aspects, 3
        tenses, 3 moods, and 2 voices for its verbal conjugation. Adjectives must
        agree in number, gender, and case with their nouns.\n\nIn order to understand
        Ukrainian grammar, it is necessary to understand the various phonological
        rules that occur due to the collision of two or more sounds. Doing so markedly
        decreases the number of exceptions and makes understanding the rules better.
        The origin of some of these phonological rules can be traced all the way back
        to Indo-European gradation ([[Indo-European ablaut|ablaut]]). This is especially
        common in explaining the differences between the infinitive and present stem
        of many verbs.\n\nThis article will present the grammar of the literary language,
        which is in the main followed by most dialects. The main differences in the
        dialects are vocabulary with occasional differences in phonology and morphology.
        Further information can be found in the article [[Ukrainian dialects]].\n\n==Phonology==\nThe
        following points of Ukrainian phonology need to be considered in order to
        properly understand the grammar of Ukrainian.\n\n===Classification of vowels===\nTwo
        different classifications of [[vowel]]s can be made: a historical perspective
        and a modern perspective. From a historical perspective, the Ukrainian vowels
        can be divided into two categories:\n# Hard vowels (in Cyrillic: \u0430, \u0438
        (from Common Slavic *\u044b), \u043e, and \u0443 or transliterated as ''''a,
        y (from Common Slavic *y), o,'''' and ''''u''''; )\n# Soft vowels (in Cyrillic:
        \u0435, \u0456 and \u0438 (from Common Slavic *\u0438) or transliterated as
        ''''e, i'''' and ''''y (from Common Slavic *i)'''').  The [[iotified vowel]]s
        are considered to be soft vowels\nFrom a modern perspective, the Ukrainian
        vowels can be divided into two categories:\n# Hard Vowels (In Cyrillic: \u0430,
        \u0435, \u0438, \u0456, \u043e, and \u0443 or transliterated as ''''a, e,
        y, i, o,'''' and ''''u''''). This category as can be seen from the table is
        different from the historical hard category\n# Iotified Vowel (In Cyrillic:
        \u044f, \u0454, \u0457, and \u044e or transliterated as ''''ja, je, ji,''''
        and ''''ju''''). To this category can also be added the combination of letters
        \u0439\u043e/\u044c\u043e (transliterated as ''''jo'''')\n\n===Classification
        of consonants===\nIn Ukrainian, [[consonant]]s can be categorised as follows:\n*
        ''''''Labials'''''' (in Cyrillic: \u0431, \u0432, \u043c, \u043f, and \u0444
        or transliterated as ''''b, v, m, p,'''' and ''''f''''): These letters are
        almost always hard in Ukrainian (there are orthographic exceptions), can never
        be doubled, nor can they in general be followed by an [[iotified vowel]] (exception:
        in combinations ''''CL'''' where ''''C'''' is a [[dental consonant|dental]]
        and ''''L'''' is a [[labial consonant|labial]], a soft vowel can follow, e.g.,
        svjato/\u0441\u0432\u044f\u0442\u043e).\n* ''''''Post-alveolar sibilants''''''
        (in Cyrillic: \u0436, \u0447, and \u0448 or transliterated as ''''\u017e,
        \u010d,'''' and ''''\u0161''''. The digraph \u0449 (''''\u0161\u010d'''')
        should also be included). These letters were in Common Slavic all [[palatal]]
        (soft). In Ukrainian, these harden, leading to the creation of the mixed [[declension]]
        of nouns. None of them can be followed by a soft sign (in Cyrillic: \u044c;
        transliterated as apostrophe (\u2019)) or any iotified vowel. All but the
        digraph can be doubled, in which case they can be followed by a soft vowel,
        e.g., ''''zbi\u017e\u017eja''''/\u0437\u0431\u0456\u0436\u0436\u044f.\n* ''''''Dentals''''''
        (in Cyrillic: \u0434, \u0437, \u043b, \u043d, \u0441, \u0442 and \u0446 or
        transliterated as ''''d, z, l, n, s, t,'''' and ''''c''''): In Ukrainian,
        as in Common Slavic, these letters can be both hard and soft. These letters  can
        never (unless they are the last letter in a prefix) be followed by an apostrophe.
        Furthermore, these letters can be doubled.\n* ''''''Alveolar'''''' (in Cyrillic:
        \u0440 or transliterated as ''''r''''): This letter can be either hard or
        soft. It is always hard at the end of a syllable. Therefore, ''''r'''' is
        always hard at the end of a word and is never followed by a soft sign. ''''r''''
        can never be doubled, except in foreign words (such as \u0441\u044e\u0440\u0440\u0435\u0430\u043b\u0456\u0437\u043c).\n*
        ''''''Velars'''''' (in Cyrillic: \u0433, \u0491, \u043a, and \u0445 or transliterated
        as ''''h, g, k,'''' and ''''x''''): In both Ukrainian and Common Slavic, these
        letters are always hard. Should they ever be followed by an iotified or soft
        vowel, then they undergo the first and second palatalisations. Hence, these
        letters can never be doubled or followed by an apostrophe.\n\n===Historical
        changes===\nIn the Ukrainian language, the following sound changes have occurred
        between the [[Proto-Slavic|Common Slavic]] period and current Ukrainian:\n\n#
        In a newly closed [[syllable]], that is, a syllable that ends in a [[consonant]],
        Common Slavic ''''o'''' and ''''e'''' mutate into ''''i'''' if the next [[vowel]]
        in Common Slavic was one of the [[yer]]s (''''\u01d0'''' (\u044c) or ''''\u01d4''''
        (\u044a)).\n# [[Pleophony]]: The Common Slavic combinations, ''''ToRT''''
        and ''''TeRT'''', where ''''T'''' is any consonant and ''''R'''' is either
        ''''r'''' or ''''l'''' become in Ukrainian\n## ''''TorT'''' gives ''''ToroT''''
        (Common Slavic ''''*borda'''' gives Ukrainian ''''boroda'''')\n## ''''TolT''''
        gives ''''ToloT'''' (Common Slavic ''''*bolto'''' gives Ukrainian ''''boloto'''')\n##
        ''''TerT'''' gives ''''TereT'''' (Common Slavic ''''*berza'''' gives Ukrainian
        ''''bereza'''')\n## ''''TelT'''' gives ''''ToloT'''' (Common Slavic ''''*melko''''
        gives Ukrainian ''''moloko'''')\n# The Common Slavic nasal vowel ''''\u0119''''
        is reflected as ''''ja'''' except after a single [[labial consonant|labial]]
        where it is reflected as ''''\u2033ja'''' (\u2019\u044f), or after a [[post-alveolar]]
        sibilant where it is reflected as ''''a.'''' Examples: Common Slavic ''''*p\u0119t\u012d''''
        gives in Ukrainian ''''p\u2033jat'''''' (\u043f\u2019\u044f\u0442\u044c);
        Common Slavic ''''*tel\u0119'''' gives in Ukrainian ''''telja''''; and Common
        Slavic ''''kur\u010d\u0119'''' gives in Ukrainian ''''kur\u010da.'''' This
        Common Slavic nasal vowel is derived from an Indo-European ''''*-en'''', ''''*-em'''',
        or one of the [[sonant]]s ''''n'''' and ''''m''''.\n# The Common Slavic letter,
        ''''\u011b'''' (\u0463), is reflected in Ukrainian generally as ''''i''''
        except:\n## word-initially, where it is reflected as ''''ji'''': Common Slavic
        ''''*\u011bsti'''' gives the Ukrainian ''''jisty''''\n## after the post-alveolar
        sibilants where it is reflected as ''''a'''': Common Slavic ''''*le\u017e\u011bti''''
        gives the Ukrainian ''''le\u017eaty''''\n# Common Slavic ''''i'''' and ''''y''''
        are both reflected in Ukrainian as ''''y''''\n# The Common Slavic combination
        ''''-C\u01d0jV'''', where ''''C'''' is any consonant and ''''V'''' is any
        vowel, becomes in Ukrainian the following combination ''''-CCjV'''', except\n##
        if ''''C'''' is labial or ''r'' where it becomes ''''-C\"jV''''\n## if ''''V''''
        is the Common Slavic ''''e'''', then the vowel in Ukrainian mutates to ''''a'''',
        e.g., Common Slavic ''''*\u017eit\u012dje'''' gives the Ukrainian ''''\u017eyttja''''\n##
        if ''''V'''' is the Common Slavic ''''\u012d'''', then the combination becomes
        ''''ej'''', e.g., genitive plural in Common Slavic ''''*my\u0161\u012dj\u012d''''
        give in Ukrainian ''''my\u0161ej''''\n## if one or more consonants precede
        the ''C'' then there is no doubling of the consonants in Ukrainian\n# Common
        Slavic combinations ''''dl'''' and ''''tl'''' are simplified to ''''l'''',
        for example, Common Slavic ''''*mydlo'''' gives Ukrainian ''''mylo''''\n#
        Common Slavic ''''\u01d4l'''' ([[voiced]] ''''l\u0325'''') and ''''\u01d0l''''
        (voiced ''''\u013a\u0325'''') became ''''ov'''', while word final ''''*l\u01d4''''
        became ''''v''''. For example, Common Slavic ''''*v\u013a\u0325k\u01d4''''
        becomes ''''vovk'''' in Ukrainian\n\n===Current changes===\n# The first [[Palatalization
        (phonetics)|palatalisation]] concerns the [[velars]] and the following vowels:
        ''''e,'''' ''''y'''' from Common Slavic ''''i'''', ''''a/i'''' from Common
        Slavic ''''\u011b'''', that is derived from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Indo-European]]
        ''''\u0113'''':\n## ''''h''''/''''g'''' before these vowels mutates into ''''\u017e''''\n##
        ''''k'''' before these vowels mutates into ''''\u010d''''\n## ''''x'''' before
        these vowels mutates into ''''\u0161''''\n# The second palatalisation concerns
        the velars and the following vowels: ''''y'''' from Common Slavic ''''i''''
        that is derived from an Indo-European diphthong and ''''a/i'''' from Common
        Slavic ''''\u011b'''' that is derived from an Indo-European diphthong:\n##
        ''''h''''/''''g'''' before these vowels mutates into ''''z''''\n## ''''k''''
        before these vowels mutates into ''''c''''\n## ''''x'''' before these vowels
        mutates into ''''s''''\n# The [[iotification]] concerns all consonants and
        the semi-vowel ''''j'''' (\u0439). The following changes occur:\n## The [[labial
        consonant|labials]] insert an ''''l'''' between the labial and the [[semivowel]]:
        Common Slavic ''''*zemja'''' give Ukrainian ''''zemlja''''.\n## The velars
        followed by a semivowel mutate as in the first palatalisation. The semivowel
        is dropped. This change can be traced back to Common Slavic.\n## ''''ktj''''
        becomes ''''\u010d''''\n## ''''tj'''' becomes ''''\u010d''''\n## ''''dj''''
        becomes ''''\u017e'''', except in verbs where it becomes ''''d\u017e''''\n##
        ''''sj'''' becomes ''''\u0161''''\n## ''''stj'''' and ''''skj'''' become ''''\u0161\u010d''''
        (\u0449)\n## ''''zdj'''' and ''''zhj'''' become ''''\u017ed\u017e''''\n##
        ''''zkj'''' becomes ''''\u017e\u010d''''\n## ''''lj, nj, rj'''' becomes ''''l,
        n, r'''' (that is, ''''\u043b\u044c, \u043d\u044c, \u0440\u044c'''')\n# In
        Ukrainian, when two or more consonants occur word-finally, then a float vowel
        is inserted under the following conditions.<ref>{{cite book|title = A Guide

        where ''''C'''' is any Ukrainian consonant. The fill vowel is inserted between
        the two consonants and after the ''''\u044c''''. A fill vowel is only inserted
        if ''''C<sub>2</sub>'''' is one of the following consonants: ''''k, v, l,
        m, r, n,'''' and ''''c''''. In this case:\n## If ''''C<sub>1</sub>'''' is
        one of the following ''''h, k,'''' or ''''x'''', then the fill vowel is always
        ''''o''''\n## If ''''C<sub>2</sub>'''' is ''''k'''' or ''''v'''', then the

        and ''''-s\u2032k'''' are not broken up\n## If the ''''C<sub>1</sub>'''' is
        ''''j'''' (\u0439), then the above rules can apply. However, both forms (with
        and without the fill vowel) often exist\n\n===Assimilation===\nThe following
        [[assimilation (linguistics)|assimilations]] occur:\n*Before the \u0441 of
        a suffix (-\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0438\u0439 or -\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e)\n**If
        the root ends in \u0433(\u0491), \u0436, or \u0437, then it mutates to \u0437
        and the \u0441 of the suffix is lost.\n**If the root ends in \u043a, \u0447,
        or \u0446, then it mutates to \u0446 and the \u0441 of the suffix is lost.\n**If
        the root ends in \u0445, \u0441, or \u0448, then it mutates to \u0441 and
        the \u0441 of the suffix is lost (or the last letter of the root drops out).\n*The
        following combinations of letters are changes:\n**{\u0436, \u0437} + \u0434\u043d
        is contracted to {\u0436, \u0437} + \u043d.\n**\u0441\u0442 + {\u043b, \u043d}
        is contracted to \u0441 + {\u043b, \u043d}.\n**{\u043f, \u0440} + \u0442\u043d
        is contracted to {\u043f, \u0440} + \u043d.\n**{\u0441, \u043a} + \u043a\u043d
        is contracted to {\u0441, \u043a} + \u043d.\n\n===Dissimilation===\nThe most
        common [[dissimilation]] is encountered in the infinitive of verbs, where
        {\u0434, \u0442} + \u0442 dissimilates to \u0441\u0442, for example, \u043a\u0440\u0430\u0434
        + \u0442\u0438 gives \u043a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438 and \u043f\u043b\u0435\u0442
        + \u0442\u0438 gives \u043f\u043b\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0438.\n\n==Morphology==\n\n===Nominal===\n\n====Nouns====\nThe
        nominal [[declension]] has seven [[declension|cases]] ([[nominative]], [[genitive]],
        [[Dative case|dative]], [[Accusative case|accusative]], [[instrumental case|instrumental]],
        [[locative case|locative]], and [[vocative]]), in two numbers ([[Grammatical
        number|singular]] and [[plural]]), and absolutely obeying [[grammatical gender]]
        (masculine, feminine and neuter). Adjectives, pronouns, and the first two
        cardinal numbers have gender specific forms.\n\nA third number, the [[Dual
        grammatical number|dual]], also existed in [[Old Ruthenian|Old East Slavic]],
        but except for its use in the nominative and accusative cases with the numbers
        two, three and four, e.g. ''''''dvi hryvni''''''/''''''\u0434\u0432\u0456
        \u0433\u0440\u0438\u0432\u043d\u0456'''''' vs. ''''''dvoje hryven'' ''''''/''''''\u0434\u0432\u043e\u0454
        \u0433\u0440\u0438\u0432\u0435\u043d\u044c'''''' (recategorised today as a
        nominative plural), it has been lost. Other traces of the dual can be found
        when referring to objects of which there are commonly two: eyes, shoulders,
        ears, ''''e.g.'''' ''''ple\u010dyma''''. Occasionally, dual forms can distinguish
        between meanings.\n\nIn Ukrainian, there are 4 declension types. The first
        declension is used for most feminine nouns. The second declension is used
        for most masculine and neuter nouns. The third declension is used for feminine
        nouns ending in ''''''\u044c'''''' or a post-alveolar sibilant. The fourth
        declension is used for neuter nouns ending in ''''''\u044f/\u0430'''''' (Common
        Slavic ''''*\u0119'''').\n\nMost of the types consist of 3 different subgroups:
        hard, mixed, and soft. The soft subgroup consists of nouns whose roots end
        in a soft letter (followed by iotified vowel or soft vowel). The mixed subgroup
        consists of the nouns whose roots end in a post-alveolar sibilant or occasionally
        ''''r''''. The hard group consists of all other nouns.\n\nIf the hard group
        endings are taken as the basis, then the following rules can be used to derive
        the corresponding mixed and soft endings:\n*Mixed subgroup\n*# All o following
        a post-alveolar sibilant change to e.\n*# All \u0438 following a post-alveolar
        sibilant change to i.\n*Soft subgroup: Whenever a soft sign or the semi-vowel
        encounters the vowel of the ending, the following changes occur (These are
        mainly orthographic changes, but same can be traced to similar changes in
        Common Slavic):\n*# \u044c\u0430 and \u0439\u0430 gives \u044f\n*# \u044c\u043e
        gives \u0435\n*# \u0439\u0435 gives \u0454\n*# \u044c\u0438 gives \u0456\n*#
        \u0439\u0438 gives \u0457\n*# \u044c\u0443 and \u0439\u0443 gives \u044e\n*#
        \u044c\u0456  gives \u0456\n*# \u0439\u0456 gives \u0457\n\nNouns ending in
        a consonant are marked in the following tables with \u2205 (thus no ending).\n\n=====First
        declension=====\n\nThis declension consists of nouns that end in \u0430 or
        \u044f. It consists primarily of feminine nouns, but a few nouns with these
        ending referring to professions can be either masculine or feminine. In these
        cases, the genitive plural is often formed by adding -\u0456\u0432. Nouns
        referring to people can also take this ending.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" align=center\n|+

        is a small group of nouns.\n*(8) The genitive form is used with animate objects,
        while inanimate objects take the nominative forms.\n\n''''''Neuter nouns''''''\nIn
        this category belong neuter nouns ending in \u043e, \u0435, and those substantives
        ending in \u044f, preceded by either a double consonant, apostrophe, or two
        consonants, which primarily are derived from verbs. This last category once
        did end in ''''*\u012dj\u0435'''', but due to the sound change given above
        developed an \u044f ending.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" align=center\n|+ ''''''Second

        The double consonant is made single if the \u044c is used. However, if a post-alveolar
        sibilant is the last consonant, then no \u044c is used, but a single consonant
        is also written. For a labial final consonant, the ending is -\u2019\u0457\u0432.
        Finally, monosyllabic nouns take the ending -\u0456\u0432. If two or more
        consonants appear word finally, then it is possible that a fill vowel must
        be inserted.\n\n=====Third declension=====\nThis declension consists solely

        Slavic ending ''''*-\u012dj\u01eb'''', doubling of the consonant occurs as
        per the rules outlined above. Furthermore, if in the nominative form the noun
        has an -\u0456 for an -\u043e, then so will the instrumental form, for example,
        \u043d\u0456\u0447\u0447\u044e (instrumental singular) and \u043d\u0456\u0447

        adjectives agree with the nouns they modify in gender, number, and case.\n\nIn
        Ukrainian, there exist a small number of adjectives, primarily possessives,
        which exist in the masculine in the so-called ''''short'''' form. This \"short\"
        form is a relic of the indefinite declension of adjectives in Common Slavic.
        Common examples of this anomalous declension are ''''\u0431\u0430\u0431\u0438\u043d''''
        (masculine) compared to ''''\u0431\u0430\u0431\u0438\u043d\u0430'''' (feminine);
        ''''\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0456\u0432'''' (masculine) compared to ''''\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0432\u0430''''
        (feminine); and ''''\u043f\u043e\u0432\u0438\u043d\u0435\u043d'''' (masculine)
        compared to ''''\u043f\u043e\u0432\u0438\u043d\u043d\u0430''''. This ''''short''''
        form only exists in the masculine nominative form. All other forms are regular.\n\n=====Declension=====\nIn
        Ukrainian, there are 2 different declension types: hard and soft. The soft
        type can be further subdivided into two types. Unlike for the nouns, the post-alveolar
        sibilants are counted as hard. There also exists a special mixed declension
        for adjectives ending in -\u043b\u0438\u0446\u0438\u0439. These adjectives
        are derived from the noun \u043b\u0438\u0446\u0435, describing types of faces,
        for example, \u0431\u0456\u043b\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0446\u0438\u0439.\n\n{|

        In the accusative case (except the feminine singular), a difference is made
        between animate (=genitive) and inanimate (=nominative) adjectives.\n*(2)
        The ending in ''''-\u043e\u043c\u0443'''' is more often encountered. The other
        form is a relic of the indefinite declension of adjectives in Common Slavic.\n\n=====Other
        forms of the adjective=====\nIn Ukrainian adjectives also have a comparative
        and superlative forms.\n\nThe [[Comparison (grammar)|comparative]] form is
        created by dropping ''''\u0438\u0439'''' and adding the ending ''''-(\u0456)\u0448\u0438\u0439''''.
        The resulting form is declined like a regular hard stem adjective. As usual,
        some adjectives have irregular forms.\n\nThe [[superlative]] form is created
        by prefixing ''''\u043d\u0430\u0439-'''' to the comparative form. Words associated
        with religion often prefix ''''\u043f\u0440\u0435-'''' (very) to the comparative
        form. As usual, some adjectives have irregular forms.\n\n====Adverbs====\nIn
        Ukrainian, [[adverbs]] are formed by taking the stem of the adjective (that
        is dropping the ''''\u2212\u0430'''' from the feminine nominative singular
        form; forms ending in \u2212\u044f are replaced by ''''\u2212\u044c\u0430''''
        (after consonants) or ''''\u2212\u0439\u0430'''' (after vowels), before dropping
        the ''''\u2212\u0430''''.) and adding the ending\n* ''''-\u043e'''', is the
        general ending,\n* ''''-\u0435'''', can be used for some stems that are hard
        (no \u044c or \u0439 at the end), for example, ''''\u0434\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0435''''
        from ''''\u0434\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0438\u0439''''. This is very common for
        the comparative form of the adjective.\n\nFor example, ''''\u0433\u0430\u0440\u043d\u0438\u0439''''
        gives ''''\u0433\u0430\u0440\u043d\u043e''''. The comparative and superlative
        forms of an adverb are formed by taking the corresponding form of the adjective
        and replacing ''''\u2212\u0438\u0439'''' by ''''-\u0435'''', for example,
        ''''\u0433\u0430\u0440\u043d\u0456\u0448\u0435'''' from ''''\u0433\u0430\u0440\u043d\u0456\u0448\u0438\u0439''''.\n\nAdverbs
        can also be derived from the locative or instrumental singular of a noun,
        for example, ''''\u0432\u0432\u0435\u0447\u0435\u0440\u0456'''' (from \u0432
        plus the locative of \u0432\u0435\u0447\u0435\u0440\u0430), ''''\u043d\u0430\u0433\u043e\u0440\u0456''''
        (from \u043d\u0430 plus the locative of \u0433\u043e\u0440\u0430).\n\n====Pronouns====\n\n=====Personal

        Any soft signs are dropped if they occur word finally in the original cardinal
        number.\n*(2) This is a dual construction.\n*(3) This is a plural nominative
        construction.\n*(4) This is the genitive plural construction (All hundreds
        after 500 are so created.).\n\nIn general, the following rules are used to
        determine agreement between the cardinal number and a noun. In the nominative
        case, the nouns agree with the last number in any compound number. Nouns that
        must agree with a number ending in 2, 3, or 4 are in the nominative plural,
        but retain the stress of the dual, that is the genitive singular. Nouns, which
        must agree with a number ending in 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0, and all the teens are
        in the genitive plural. In any other case, the nouns and numbers are in the
        same case.\n\n===Verbs===\n[[Grammatical conjugation]] is subject to three
        [[Grammatical person|persons]] in two numbers and three simple [[Grammatical
        tense|tenses]] (present/future, future, and past), with [[periphrasis|periphrastic]]
        forms for the future and [[Conditional mood|Conditional]], as well as [[Imperative
        mood|imperative]] forms and present/past [[participle]]s, distinguished by
        [[adjective|adjectival]] and [[adverb]]ial usage.  There are two [[grammatical
        voice|voices]], [[active voice|active]] and [[middle voice|middle]]/[[passive
        voice|passive]], which is constructed by the addition of a reflexive [[suffix]]
        ''''''-\u0441\u044f/\u0441\u044c'''''' to the active form.  An interesting
        feature is that the past tense is actually made to agree in gender with the
        [[Subject (grammar)|subject]], for it is the [[participle]] in an originally
        periphrastic [[perfect (grammar)|perfect]] formed with the present of ''''''\u0431\u044b\u0442\u044c''''''
        (modern: ''''''\u0431\u0443\u0442\u0438'''''') {{IPA|/b\u0268t\u02b2/}},\"to
        be.\" Verbal inflection today is considerably simpler than in Common Slavic.
        The ancient [[aorist]], [[imperfect]], and (periphrastic) [[pluperfect]] have
        been lost. The loss of three of the former six tenses has been offset by the
        reliance, as in other Slavic languages, on verbal [[grammatical aspect|aspect]].  Most
        verbs come in pairs, one with [[imperfective aspect|imperfective]] or continuous
        connotation, the other with [[perfective aspect|perfective]] or completed,
        usually formed with a (prepositional) prefix, but occasionally using a different
        root.\n\nThe present tense of the verb ''''''\u0431\u0443\u0442\u0438'''''',
        \"[[copula (linguistics)|to be]]\", today normally has the form, ''''\u0454''''
        used for all persons and numbers. Previously (before 1500) and occasionally
        in liturgical settings, aspects of the full conjugation, can be found. The
        paradigm shows as well as anything else the Indo-European affinity of Ukrainian:\n\n{|

        Ukrainian forms followed by * are considered archaic in Standard Ukrainian
        (albeit those are still used in dialects) and are replaced by \u0454. In the
        present tense, the verb ''''''\u0431\u0443\u0442\u0438'''''' is often omitted
        (or replaced by a dash \"\u2014\" in writing), for example, \u042f \u2014
        \u0441\u0442\u0443\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0442.\n\n====Classification of verbs====\nThere
        exist two different classification of verbs: traditional and historical/linguistic.\n\nThe
        traditional classification of verbs subdivides the verbs into two categories
        based on the form of the 3rd person singular present indicative form of the
        verb.\n# The ''''\u0435'''' stems, which have the ending ''''-\u0435'''' or
        ''''-\u0454'''' in the 3rd person singular.\n# The ''''\u0438'''' stems, which
        have the ending ''''-\u0438\u0442\u044c'''' in the 3rd person singular.\n\nThe
        historical/linguistic classification of verbs subdivides the verbs into 5
        categories. Classes 1,2 and 3 correspond to the ''''\u0435'''' stems of the
        traditional classification, while class 4 corresponds to the ''''\u0438''''
        stems. Class 5 consists of the athematic verbs.<ref>\n{{cite book|title =

        had 2 voices: (1) [[active voice]] and (2) [[passive voice]]. The active voice
        is the only voice with a complete set of conjugations. The active voice, in
        general, shows a direct effect of the verb on its subject.\n\n====Indicative
        active mood====\nThe [[indicative mood]] is used to describe events, which
        have occurred, are occurring, or will occur. In Ukrainian, the indicative
        mood contains the present, future, and past tenses.\n\n=====Present tense=====\nHistorically,
        this is derived from the Indo-European present tense. In Common Slavic and
        later Ukrainian, it retained its present meaning only for imperfective verbs
        and developed a future meaning for perfective verbs.\n\nFor the ''''\u0435''''
        stems (Classes 1, 2, and 3), the endings are:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"center\"\n|+
        ''''''\u0435 stem endings''''''\n! \n! singular\n! plural\n|-\n| ''''''First
        Person'''''' || -\u0443 / -\u044e || -\u0435\u043c\u043e / -\u0454\u043c\u043e
        \n|-\n| ''''''Second Person'''''' || -\u0435\u0448 / -\u0454\u0448 ||-\u0435\u0442\u0435

        || -\u0443\u0442\u044c / -\u044e\u0442\u044c\n|}\n\nAll verbs whose roots
        end in a velar undergo the first palatalisation in all forms of the present
        (even though historically speaking the first person singular should not).
        The endings in ''''\u0454'''' are used for roots whose stem ends in a vowel.
        All verbs in Class 3 and those that end in a vowel use ''''-\u044e'''' and
        ''''-\u044e\u0442\u044c''''. Furthermore, Class 3 verbs undergo iotification
        in those forms that use ''''-\u044e-''''. For reflexive verbs, in the third
        person singular, the ending has its historical ''''-\u0442\u044c'''' restored
        before the participle ''''-\u0441\u044f / -\u0441\u044c'''' is affixed. Thus,
        the ending becomes ''''-\u0435\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f''''.\n\nFor the ''''\u0438''''
        stems (Class 4), the endings are:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"center\"\n|+

        Class 4 verbs undergo iotification in the first person singular. Thus, there
        is really only one ending, which due to orthographic reasons is given 2 different
        forms. Verbs ending in a vowel take the endings in the second column. In the
        third person plural, verbs ending in a labial insert an ''''\u043b'''' before
        the ending, ''''-\u044f\u0442\u044c''''. The ending ''''-\u0430\u0442\u044c''''
        is used after the sibilants ''''\u0436, \u0448, \u0449'''', or ''''\u0447''''.\n\n======Examples======\n{|

        example, the [[Latin grammar|Latin]] first conjugation participle ending ''''-atus'''').
        Thus, the past tense agrees in number and gender with the subject of the verb.
        The following endings are added to the infinitive with the ending ''''-\u0442\u0438''''
        removed (Most root final ''''\u0434'''' and ''''\u0442'''' are dropped):\n\n*masculine
        singular: ''''-\u0432''''\n**Note: It is lost after ''''\u0441, \u0437, \u043a,
        \u0433, \u0431, \u0440''''.\n**Note 2: Stems ending in ''''\u0435'''' or ''''\u043e''''
        plus a consonant convert them to ''''\u0456'''', for example, ''''\u043d\u0456\u0441''''
        but ''''\u043d\u0435\u0441\u043b\u0430'''' and ''''\u043c\u0456\u0433''''
        but ''''\u043c\u043e\u0433\u043b\u0430''''. Stems in ''''\u044f'''' plus a
        consonant can also undergo this change.\n*feminine singular: ''''-\u043b\u0430''''\n*neuter
        singular: ''''-\u043b\u043e''''\n*plural: ''''-\u043b\u0438''''\n\nClass 2
        verbs can have forms without the \u2212\u043d\u0443, for example, ''''\u0437\u0430\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0431\u043d\u0443\u0442\u0438''''
        has the forms ''''\u0437\u0430\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0431'''', ''''\u0437\u0430\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0431\u043b\u0430'''',
        ''''\u0437\u0430\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0431\u043b\u043e'''', and ''''\u0437\u0430\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0431\u043b\u0438''''.
        Not all Class 2 verbs undergo this change.\n\nThese forms are often called
        the active past participle I. The masculine singular evolved from an earlier
        *-\u043b\u044a that delingualized (cf. [[Polish language|Polish]] ''''-\u0142'''').\n\n=====Future
        active tense=====\nIn Ukrainian, there are 2 different future tenses for imperfective
        verbs. The first form, called ''''simple'''' (''''\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430
        \u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0430''''), formed by adding to the infinitive of
        the verb the following endings, which are derived from the Common Slavic verb
        ''''*j\u0119ti'''' (Present stem: j\u012dm\u2212):\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"

        will translate as ''''will eat'''' with the appropriate personal pronoun.\n\n====Imperative
        active mood====\nThe [[imperative mood]] is used to give commands. It exists
        in only the present tense in Ukrainian. There are no forms for the 1st person
        singular. \nIn Ukrainian, the imperative mood is formed from the present stem
        of the verb plus the following endings (The example is based on Ukrainian
        ''''\u043f\u0438\u0442\u0438''''):\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"center\"\n|+

        \u043f''\u044e\u0442\u044c or \u043d\u0435\u0445\u0430\u0439 \u043f''\u044e\u0442\u044c)\n|}\n\nThe
        first set of endings is to be used for stems that end in a dentals (''''\u0437,
        \u0434, \u0442, \u0441, \u043d,'''' and ''''\u043b''''). The second set of
        ending is used for stems that end in a vowel. The third set of endings is
        used for stems that end in labials or post-alveolar sibilants (''''\u0431,
        \u0432, \u043c, \u043f, \u0444, \u0448, \u0449, \u0447, \u0436,'''' and ''''\u0440'''').
        The fourth set of endings is used with verbs whose unaffixed form (no prefixes
        or suffixes) have the stress on the ending in the first person singular of
        the present tense. As well, most Class 2 verbs and those verb roots ending
        in a consonant plus ''''\u043b'''' or ''''\u0440'''' take these endings.  Thus
        for example, ''''\u0431\u0435\u0440\u0438'''' and ''''\u0432\u0438\u0431\u0435\u0440\u0438''''.
        Class 5 verbs take the first set of endings, but undergo an archaic form of
        iotation, so that ''''\u0434\u044c'''' becomes ''''\u0436'''' (rather than
        ''''\u0434\u0436''''), for example, ''''\u0457\u0436\u0442\u0435'''' < ''''\u0457\u0434+\u044c\u0442\u0435''''.
        This does not apply to ''''\u0434\u0430\u0442\u0438'''', which is treated
        as a regular verb with a stem in ''''\u0434\u0430-''''.\n\nFinally note that
        all verbs with stems that end in ''''\u043a'''' and ''''\u0433'''' undergo
        the first palatalisation. Class 3 verbs with stems in ''''\u043a'''', ''''\u0433'''',
        and ''''\u0441'''' undergo iotification (as do their present conjugation).\n\n====Conditional
        active mood====\nThe [[Grammatical mood#Conditional|conditional mood]] is
        used to state hypothetical states, wishes, and desires. It has 2 tenses in
        Ukrainian: a present and a past.\n\n=====Present tense=====\nThe present conditional
        is formed in Ukrainian from the participle ''''\u0431\u0438'''' or the short
        form ''''\u0431'''', which is derived from the archaic aorist conjugation
        of the verb, ''''\u0431\u0443\u0442\u0438'''', and the active past participle
        I, which is the same as the past indicative participle. Thus, there is agreement
        between the subject and the participle. An example of this construction would
        be ''''\u044f \u0431\u0438 \u0445\u043e\u0442\u0456\u0432  ...'''' (I would
        like...).\n\n=====Past tense=====\nThe past conditional is formed in Ukrainian
        from the participle ''''\u0431\u0438'''' or the short form ''''\u0431''''
        followed by the active past participle I form of the verb ''''\u0431\u0443\u0442\u0438''''
        (''''\u0431\u0443\u0432, \u0431\u0443\u043b\u0430, \u0431\u0443\u043b\u043e,
        \u0431\u0443\u043b\u0438'''') and then the active past participle I of the
        verb. Both participles must agree with the subject. An example of this construction
        would be ''''\u044f\u043a \u044f \u0431\u0438 \u0431\u0443\u0432 \u0437\u043d\u0430\u0432...''''
        (had I  (had) known...). Alternatively, the past conditional can be formed
        by using the form ''''\u044f\u043a\u0431\u0438'''' and the active past participle
        I form of the verb, for example, ''''\u044f\u043a\u0431\u0438 \u044f \u0437\u043d\u0430\u0432\u2026''''.\n\n====Passive
        voice====\nThe [[passive voice]] has 2 different functions. It shows either
        that the subject has had something done to itself or that something indeterminate
        has occurred to the subject.\nIn Ukrainian, the passive voice is formed as
        follows:\n# Use of a reflexive verb: ''''\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0438\u0441\u044f''''
        (to wash oneself or in French ''''se laver'''')\n# Use of the verb ''''to
        be'''' and the past passive participle: ''''\u0412\u0456\u043d \u0431\u0443\u0432
        \u0432\u0431\u0438\u0442\u0438\u0439'''' (He was killed).\n# An impersonal
        use of the third person plural past active participle I: ''''\u0419\u043e\u0433\u043e
        \u0432\u0431\u0438\u043b\u0438'''' (He was killed).\n# The following construction:
        ''''\u0411\u0443\u043b\u043e'''' + neuter singular of past passive participle,
        the \"-\u043d\u043e/-\u0442\u043e\" form: ''''\u041c\u0456\u0441\u0442\u043e
        \u0431\u0443\u043b\u043e \u0437\u0430\u0445\u043e\u043f\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0435''''
        (The town was captured.).\n\n====Participles and verbal nouns====\n\nIn Ukrainian,
        there exist traces of all five Common Slavic participles.\n\n=====Present
        active participle=====\n\nThis participle is formed by taking the third person
        plural form, dropping the ''''\u0442\u044c'''', and adding ''''\u0447\u0438(\u0439)''''.
        Most commonly this participle is used as gerund with the form ''''\u0447\u0438''''
        with a meaning approaching the equivalent English construction with ''''-ing''''.
        Occasionally, it is used as an adjective. In this case its form is ''''\u0447\u0438\u0439''''.
        Examples of this participle are ''''\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0443\u0447\u0438'''',
        ''''\u0437\u043d\u0430\u044e\u0447\u0438'''', and ''''\u0445\u0432\u0430\u043b\u044f\u0447\u0438''''.\n\n=====Present
        passive participle=====\n\nThis participle does not exist in Ukrainian as
        a separate form. However, it is commonly encountered as an adjective in ''''-\u043c\u0438\u0439''''.
        Common examples of this participle are ''''\u0432\u0456\u0434\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0439''''
        and ''''\u0437\u043d\u0430\u0439\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0439''''.\n\n=====Past
        active participle I=====\n\nThis participle is encountered in forming the
        past tense in Ukrainian. Occasionally, it is found as an adjective for intransitive
        verbs. It is formed by taking the infinitive stem and adding the ending ''''-\u0432,
        -\u043b\u0430, -\u043b\u043e,'''' and ''''-\u043b\u0438'''' to form the past
        tense participle (in reality the indefinite form of the adjective) and the
        ending ''''-\u043b\u0438\u0439'''' to form the regular adjective. An example
        of the adjectival form is ''''\u043f\u043e\u0447\u043e\u0440\u043d\u0456\u043b\u0438\u0439''''.\n\n=====Past
        active participle II=====\n\nThis participle is most commonly encountered
        as a gerund, while it is only used occasionally as an adjective. It is formed
        by taking the masculine past participle I and adding the ending ''''-\u0448\u0438(\u0439)''''.
        An example of the gerund is ''''\u0437\u043d\u0430\u0432\u0448\u0438'''',
        while a common (dialectical) adjective would be the word ''''\u0431\u0443\u0432\u0448\u0438\u0439''''.\n\n=====Past
        passive participle=====\n\nThe past passive participle is the only participle
        used commonly as an adjective. There are two parallel forms with no difference
        in meaning: in ''''-\u0442\u0438\u0439'''' or in ''''-\u043d\u0438\u0439''''.
        This participle is formed from the infinitive stem for most verbs. Class 2
        verbs can as for other participles drop the suffix ''''\u043d\u0443'''' or
        only the ''''\u0443'''', for example, \u0434\u0432\u0438\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0439
        from \u0434\u0432\u0438\u0433\u043d\u0443\u0442\u0438. Verbs in ''''-\u0443\u0432\u0430\u0301\u0442\u0438''''
        or ''''-\u044e\u0432\u0430\u0301\u0442\u0438'''' (those whose ending is stressed)
        will replace the ''''\u0443''''  by ''''\u043e'''' and ''''\u044e'''' by ''''\u044c/\u0439\u043e''''
        (''''\u044c'''' if a consonant precedes or ''''\u0439'''' if a vowel), for
        example, \u043c\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043e\u0301\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0439
        from \u043c\u0430\u043b\u044e\u0432\u0430\u0301\u0442\u0438. Finally, Class
        3 stems with full voicing have two possible stems: the first is simply obtained
        by dropping the \u2212\u0442\u0438 from the infinitive, while the second is
        obtained by dropping the last three letters (which in effect means using the
        present form). The first form will take the \u2212\u0442\u0438\u0439 ending,
        while the second form will take the \u2212\u043d\u0438\u0439 ending, for example
        \u043f\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0442\u0438 has \u043f\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0442\u0438\u0439
        and \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0439. Note that the verb \u043c\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0442\u0438
        has the second form \u043c\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0439, since it derives
        from *melti in Common Slavonic). The ending is determined as follows:\n*If
        the stem ends in a vowel or ''''\u0435\u0440'''' or ''''\u043e\u0440'''' (derived
        from a sonant r in Common Slavonic), then\n**If the vowel is ''''\u0438, \u0443,
        \u044f'''' a sibilant plus ''''\u0430'''', ''''\u0435\u0440,'''' or ''''\u043e\u0440''''
        then add ''''-\u0442\u0438\u0439'''', for example, \u0440\u043e\u0437\u043f\u2019\u044f\u0442\u0438\u0439,
        \u0442\u0435\u0440\u0442\u0438\u0439, or \u0436\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0439.\n**For
        class 3 verbs with full voicing ending in ''''\u043e'''', then add ''''-\u0442\u0438\u0439'''',
        for example, \u043f\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0442\u0438\u0439.\n**For all Class
        4 verbs, the ending is ''''-\u0454\u043d\u0438\u0439'''', for example, \u0433\u043e\u0454\u043d\u0438\u0439.\n**Otherwise,
        the ending is ''''-\u043d\u0438\u0439''''.\n*If the stem ends in a consonant,
        then add ''''-\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0439''''. Class 1 verbs undergo the first
        palatalisation, while Class 2, 4, and 5 verbs undergo iotation, for example,
        \u043f\u0435\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0439, \u0442\u0438\u0441\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0439,
        \u043e\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0439, \u043b\u0438\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0439,
        \u043b\u044e\u0431\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0439, and \u0457\u0434\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0439.\n\n=====Verbal
        noun=====\n\nThe verbal noun is created by taking the past passive participle,
        dropping ''''\u0438\u0439'''', doubling the consonant if permitted by the
        rules under ''''-\u012djV'''', and adding a ''''\u044f''''. This will be a
        neuter noun declined like all neuter nouns in ''''*\u012dj\u0435''''. It should
        be noted that if the ''''-\u0435-'''' of the past passive participle is stressed
        then the ''''\u0435'''' will mutate into an ''''\u0456''''. Examples include
        ''''\u043f\u0438\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044f'''' from ''''\u043f\u0438\u0442\u0430\u0442\u0438''''
        and ''''\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0456\u043d\u043d\u044f'''' from ''''\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0438\u0442\u0438''''.
        Note that any Class 3 verbs in -\u0443\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0438 or -\u044e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0438
        will restore the ''''\u0443'''' or ''''\u044e'''' \u043c\u0430\u043b\u044e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044f
        from \u043c\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0439 (\u043c\u0430\u043b\u044e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0438)\n\nThe
        verbal noun in Ukrainian is derived from the Common Slavic verbal noun, where
        it was formed by adding ''''*-\u012dj\u0435'''' to the past passive participle
        without the ''''*\u016d'''' ending. Thus, in Ukrainian, the consonant is doubled
        if possible.\n\n===Word formation===\nUkrainian has a rich set of [[Prefix
        (linguistics)|prefixes]], both [[preposition]]al and [[adverb]]ial in nature,
        as well as [[diminutive]], [[augmentative]], and [[frequentative]] [[suffix]]es.
        All of these can be stacked one upon the other, to produce multiple derivatives
        of a given word.  Participles and other inflexional forms may also have a
        special [[connotation]]. For example, the word ''''''\u043d\u0430\u043f\u0456\u0432\u0432\u0456\u0434\u043a\u0440\u0438\u0442\u0438\u0439''''''
        can be split into the following prefixes and suffixes:\n<center>\u043d\u0430
        + \u043f\u0456\u0432 + \u0432\u0456\u0434 + \u043a\u0440\u0438 (root) + \u0442\u0438\u0439.
        </center>\n\n====Prefixes====\nIn Ukrainian, prefixes can be added to a root
        and stacked on top of each as in the above example. The most common prefixes
        are given in the table below. Although the prefixes have the given meaning,
        when attached to a root, it is possible that the resulting new word will have
        a unique meaning that is distantly related to the original meaning of the
        prefix. If possible the example is given using the verbal root ''''''\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0442\u0438''''''
        or the nominal root ''''''\u0445\u0456\u0434''''''.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"

        The multitude of forms in Ukrainian for the Common Slavic *s\u016d(n) (*\u0441\u044a(\u043d))
        is a result of the fact that the initial ''''s'''' could assimilate (or dissimilate)
        with the root''s initial consonants. As well, since a ''''\u044c'''' followed
        there was the potential for further sound changes. Finally, words entered
        Ukrainian from different Slavic languages with their own peculiarities or
        that the original origin of the word was lost. The following are examples

        If a prefix ends in a consonant and the root starts with two or more consonants,
        then the vowel ''''\u0456'''' is inserted between the prefix and the root,
        for example, \u0440\u043e\u0437\u0456\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0438. This

        or more adjectives can be combined into a single word using an ''''''\u043e''''''
        as the linking vowel, for example, \u0441\u0456\u043b\u044c\u0441\u044c\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0441\u043f\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0438\u0439,
        which consists of the adjectives \u0441\u0456\u043b\u044c\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0438\u0439
        and \u0433\u043e\u0441\u043f\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0438\u0439.
        If the second adjective starts with a vowel, then a dash can be used to separate
        the linking vowel and the second adjective, for example, \u0441\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043d\u044c\u043e-\u0454\u0432\u0440\u043e\u043f\u0435\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0438\u0439.\n\n====Verbs====\nIn
        addition to the suffixes and prefixes that can be added to verbs, Ukrainian
        verbs have inherited occasional traces of the Indo-European [[ablaut]]. The
        primary ablaut is the difference between long and short Indo-European vowels.
        In Ukrainian, due to the fact that the long and short vowels experienced different
        reflexes, this ablaut is reflected as a change in vowels. The resulting verbs
        are often imperfect-perfect pairs. For example, we have \u0441\u043a\u043e\u0447\u0438\u0442\u0438
        and \u0441\u043a\u0430\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0438 (simplified Indo-European *skoki-
        and *sk\u014dka-).\n\n===Fundamental sentence structure===\n\n====Coordination====\nThe
        common Ukrainian [[coordination (conjunction)|coordination]]s are:\n* \u0456
        / \u0439 / \u0442\u0430(and)\n* \u0430 (and, but)\n* \u0430\u043b\u0435 (but)\n\n====Subordination====\nCommon
        Ukrainian [[complementizer|subordinations]] are:\n\n* \u044f\u043a (how, if)\n*
        \u043a\u043e\u043b\u0438 (when)\n* \u044f\u043a\u0449\u043e (if)\n\n==Syntax==\nThe
        basic [[word order]], both in conversation and the written language, is [[subject\u2013verb\u2013object]].  However,
        because the relations are marked by [[inflexion]], considerable latitude in
        word order is allowed, and all the permutations can be used.  The word order
        expresses the [[logical stress]], and the degree of [[definiteness]].\n\n===
        Negation ===\nUnlike English, Latin, and various other languages, Ukrainian
        allows [[double negative|multiple negatives]], as in \u201cnixto nikoly nikomu
        ni\u010doho ne pro\u0161\u010daje\u201d (\u2018no-one ever forgives anyone
        anything\u2019, literally \u2018no-one never to no-one nothing does not forgive\u2019).
        Single negatives are often grammatically incorrect because when negation is
        used in complex sentences every part that could be grammatically negated should
        be negative.\n\nObjects of a negated verb are placed in the genitive case,
        where they would be accusative if the verb were not negated.\n\n===Inflectional
        usage===\n\n====Case====\nThe use of [[Grammatical case|cases]] in Ukrainian
        can be very complicated. In general, the [[nominative]], [[genitive]], [[accusative]],
        and [[vocative]] cases can be used without a [[preposition]]. On the other
        hand, the [[locative]] and [[Instrumental case|instrumental]] cases are used
        primarily with a preposition. Furthermore, and much like in [[Latin]], different
        prepositions can be followed by nouns in different cases, resulting in different
        meanings.\n\n====Aspect====\nUkrainian verbs can have one of two [[Grammatical
        aspect|aspects]]: [[imperfective]] and [[perfective]]. The imperfective form
        denotes an action that is taking place in the present, is ongoing, is repetitive,
        or is habitual. The perfective form indicates an action that is completed,
        is the result of an action, is the beginning of an action, or is shorter or
        longer than usual. For example, ''''spaty'''' (\u0441\u043f\u0430\u0442\u0438)
        is imperfective, while ''''pospaty'''' (\u043f\u043e\u0441\u043f\u0430\u0442\u0438)
        is perfective.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Ukrainian language]]\n\n==Translation

        hip hop'''''', also known as ''''''Ukra-hop'''''' or ''''''Ukr-hop'''''' is
        a major part of the [[music of Ukraine|Ukrainian music]] scene. Refers to
        all genres of [[hip hop music]] in the [[Ukrainian language]]. The term ''''''Ukr-hop''''''
        is also sometimes used to refer to any [[hip hop music]] made by [[Ukrainians]],
        including instrumental hip hop, as well as rap songs by members of the [[Ukrainian
        diaspora]].\n\n== History ==\nIn [[Ukraine]] hip hop began to develop in 1990s.
        In 1989 started their activities two biggiest hip hop groups at that time
        - [[TNMK]] and V.U.Z.V. The pioneers of Ukrainian hip hop were [[TNMK]] ([[Kharkiv]]),
        V.U.Z.V ([[Kiev]]), Osnovnyy Pokaznyk ([[Luts''k]]), [[Tartak]] ([[Lviv]])
        and [[GreenJolly]] ([[Ivano-Frankivs''k]]). At the end of the 1990s and beginning
        of the 2000s audience considered [[Kharkiv]] and [[Lviv]] as the main center
        of the Ukra.hop subculture. Many groups successfully performed at festivals
        such as [[Chervona Ruta (festival)|Chervona Ruta]] and Tavriyski Ihry. At
        the mid-2000s a lot of underground bands and artists from another [[cities
        in Ukraine]] began to appear and became popular: [[DaHok]] ([[Drohobych]]),
        Z\u0430\u0445\u0456\u0434\u043d\u0430 \u041a\u043e\u0430\u043b\u0456\u0446\u0456\u044f
        ([[Stryi]]), [[w:uk:\u041a\u0440\u0438\u0436\u0438\u043a|Kryzhyk]] ([[Uman]]),
        [[w:uk:Sheksta|Sheksta]] ([[Stryi]]),  [[w:uk:Sirius MC|Sirius MC]] ([[Kalush,
        Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast|Kalush]]) and [[w:uk:Freel|Freel]]  ([[Kiev]]).\n\nIn
        2005, Ukraine''s entrant in the [[Eurovision Song Contest]], [[GreenJolly]]''s
        \"[[Together We Are Many]]\", was also the unofficial anthem of the [[Orange
        Revolution]]. Eurovision demanded the lyrics to be changed for the contest
        (because it did not correspond to contests rules due to political content).
        Also this song was remade by [[Polish hip hop]] artists.\n\nIn 2008 hip hop
        group [[LEZO (rap group)|LEZO]] released their fourth studio album, Gostroslovy
        ([[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]]: \u0413\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0441\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0438).
        Many critics consider it one of the best in Ukrainian hip-hop industry. The
        same year KyL\u042f and RYLEZ created group [[Tulym]] - one of the most successful
        Ukrainian [[boom bap]] group.\n\nMarch 11, 2011, Ukrainian rapper [[w:uk:\u0406\u0432\u0430\u043d
        \u0411\u0443\u044f\u043d \u0411\u0427|Ivan Buyan]] presented his first music
        video filmed in [[New York City]].\n\nJune 19, 2014, [[w:uk:PVNCH|PVNCH]]
        presented their new album - Golodnyy ([[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]]: \u0413\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0434\u043d\u0438\u0439,
        translation: Hungry). According to voting results Golodnyy was named the best
        hip-hop album of 2014. April 18, 2015, [[Tulym]] from [[Kiev]] had a concert
        with legendary hip-hop band from [[New York City]] - [[Onyx (group)|Onyx]]
        in [[Sofia]], [[Bulgaria]].\n\nA rising new star of Ukrainian origin self
        proclaimed \"Nazaren tha Prophet\" (Nazar Kotovych) has been rewriting Ukrainian
        rap history in the United States. Writing and rapping since 1997 the artist
        performs and records in four different languages mixing them together. Debut
        Album \"Birth Of The Nazaren\" came out in 2012. He is due to release a very
        politically charged album in 2016 titled \"Partec Mendacii\" and another one
        in the beginning of 2017. This artist is thought to make a real buzz the rap
        critics say \"in the up coming years he will put Ukrainian hip-hop on the
        level of its predecessors and in the public view of the world\".\n\n== Style
        ==\nMusically, Ukrainian hip hop is heavily influenced by [[Reggae|Jamaican
        reggae]] and [[Ukrainian folk music]], resulting a very tuneful and mellow
        sound, which makes it quite different from both Russian and American counterparts.\n\n==

        a role in assigning different areas of Ukraine to semi-official regions. The
        map on the right shows the approximate locations of some broad-brush regions.
        The terms \"West Ukraine\", \"East Ukraine\", \"South Ukraine\" and \"Central
        Ukraine\" occur in common usage. There is no clear definition of the boundaries
        of such regions, but rather a general reference. Lists of what may constitute
        such regions might include:\n\n*[[Western Ukraine]] may mean either the historic
        region of Galicia, or may also include Volhynia, Podolia, Transcarpathia,
        and/or Bukovina.\n*[[Eastern Ukraine]] may mean either the Don basin, Sloboda
        Ukraine, continental Taurida regions etc.\n*[[South Ukraine]] often includes
        the whole Taurida, the Kryvyi Rih basin, and the regions of Mykolayiv and
        Odessa oblasts. Alternatively it may include the Don basin, in particularly
        the adjacent land to the Azov Sea.\n*[[Central Ukraine]], a more vague term,
        often denotes what is not included in Western or South-Eastern definitions.\n\nOther
        terms are rarely used - such as \"South-West Ukraine\", which can denote either
        [[Carpathian Ruthenia|Transcarpathia]], or [[Budjak]]. Sometimes the term
        \"[[South-Eastern Ukraine]]\" is used to define both regions of the Southern
        and Eastern Ukraine. Due to the shape of the country, in narrow definition,
        term \"Northern Ukraine\" is often used to denote either the bulge of [[Chernihiv
        Oblast|Chernihiv]]/[[Sumy Oblast]]s or, in broader terms, the whole of [[Polesia]].
        \"North-western Ukraine\" almost exclusively refers to the historic region
        of [[Volhynia]]. This makes the term \"North-Eastern Ukraine\" rarest of them
        all - it is either used as synonym for the narrow definition of Northern Ukraine,
        or as synonym for Sloboda Ukraine (particularly the [[Sumy Oblast]]).\n\n<gallery>\nImage:Western

        [[ISO 4217|code]]: ''''''UAH''''''), has been the national [[currency]] of
        [[Ukraine]] since 2 September 1996. The hryvnia is subdivided into 100 ''''kopiyky''''.
        It is named after [[Grzywna (unit)|a measure of weight]] used in medieval
        [[Kievan Rus'']].\n\n==Name==\n\n===Etymology===\n{{see also|Grzywna (unit)}}\nThe
        [[currency]] of [[Kievan Rus'']] in the eleventh century was called ''''grivna''''.
        The word is thought to derive from the [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] ''''griva'''';
        c.f. [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], Russian, [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]],
        and [[Serbo-Croatian]] ''''\u0433\u0440\u0438\u0432\u0430 / griva'''', meaning
        \"mane\". It might have indicated something valuable worn around the neck,
        usually made of [[silver]] or [[gold]]; c.f. Bulgarian and Serbian ''''grivna''''
        (\u0433\u0440\u0438\u0432\u043d\u0430, \"bracelet\"). Later, the word was
        used to describe silver or gold ingots of a certain weight; c.f. [[Ukrainian
        language|Ukrainian]] ''''hryvenyk'''' (\u0433\u0440\u0438\u0432\u0435\u043d\u0438\u043a),
        Russian ''''grivennik'''' (\u0433\u0440\u0438\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0438\u043a,
        \"10-kopek piece\").\n\nThe modern Ukrainian hryvnia is sometimes [[transliteration|transliterated]]
        as ''''hryvna'''', ''''hrivna'''', ''''gryvna'''' or ''''grivna'''', due to
        its [[Russian language]] counterpart, \u0433\u0440\u0438\u0301\u0432\u043d\u0430,
        pronounced ''''gr\u00edvna''''. However, the standard English name for the
        currency is ''''hryvnia''''.<ref>[http://www.iso.org/iso/support/faqs/faqs_widely_used_standards/widely_used_standards_other/currency_codes/currency_codes_list-1.htm
        ISO 4217 currency names and code elements]</ref>\n\nThe [[National Bank of
        Ukraine]] has recommended that a distinction be made between ''''hryvnia''''
        and ''''gr\u00edvna'''' in both historical and practical means.{{Citation
        needed|date=June 2007}}\n\n===Plural===\nThe [[nominative case|nominative]]
        plural of hryvnia is ''''hryvni'''' ({{lang-uk|\u0433\u0440\u0438\u0432\u043d\u0456}}),
        while the [[genitive case|genitive]] plural is ''''hryven\u2032'''' ({{lang-uk|\u0433\u0440\u0438\u0432\u0435\u043d\u044c}}).
        In Ukrainian, the nominative plural form is used for numbers ending with 2,
        3, or 4, as in ''''dvi hryvni'''' (\u0434\u0432\u0456 \u0433\u0440\u0438\u0432\u043d\u0456,
        \"2 hryvni\"), and the genitive plural is used for numbers ending with 5 to
        9 and 0, for example ''''sto hryven\u2019'''' (\u0441\u0442\u043e \u0433\u0440\u0438\u0432\u0435\u043d\u044c,
        \"100 hryven\u2019\"); for numbers ending with 1 the nominative singular form
        is used, for example ''''dvadtsiat\u2019 odna hryvnia'''' (\u0434\u0432\u0430\u0434\u0446\u044f\u0442\u044c

        An exception for this rule is numbers ending in 11, 12, 13 and 14 for which
        the genitive plural is also used, for example, ''''dvanadtsiat\u2019 hryven\u2019''''
        (\u0434\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0430\u0434\u0446\u044f\u0442\u044c \u0433\u0440\u0438\u0432\u0435\u043d\u044c,
        \"12 hryven\u2019\"). The singular for the subdivision is \u043a\u043e\u043f\u0456\u0439\u043a\u0430
        (''''kopiyka''''), the nominative plural is \u043a\u043e\u043f\u0456\u0439\u043a\u0438
        (''''kopiyky'''') and the genitive is \u043a\u043e\u043f\u0456\u0439\u043e\u043a
        (''''kopiyok'''').\n\n==Currency sign==\n[[Image:Hryvnia symbol.svg|50px|left|Hryvnia

        a compromise between the [[President of Ukraine|President]] and [[Verkhovna
        Rada]]. Incumbent President [[Leonid Kravchuk]] lost the presidency to his
        former [[Prime Minister of Ukraine|Prime Minister]] [[Leonid Kuchma]].\n\n==Background==\n\n===Strikes
        and revival of communists===\nOn June 7, 1993 started a time-unrestricted
        strike of coal miners of [[Donets basin]] as part of a chronic economical
        crisis. Coincidentally all the events appeared at the time of resurrection
        of the [[Communist Party of Ukraine]]. On this wave of strikes a Constituent
        Congress of the [[Communist Party of Ukraine]] took place on June 19, 1993
        in [[Donetsk]] (same region) and later it was registered in October of the
        same year. Its banning was temporary due to suspicion in support of the August
        coup-d''etat. However the Constitutional Court of Ukraine recognized that
        the Communist Party of Ukraine that was registered on July 22, 1991 had nothing
        to do with the August events in the [[Soviet Union]] and was never a successor
        of the Communist Party of Soviet Union and the Communist Party of Ukraine
        in the Communist Party of Soviet Union. However the statute of the Communist
        Party of Ukraine clearly indicates otherwise.<ref name=\"statute\"/> Moreover
        on December 27, 2001 the Constitutional Court of Ukraine recognized the ban
        of Communist Party not constitutional.<ref name=\"statute\">{{uk icon}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20140923003336/http://www.kpu.ua/ru/page/statute
        The Statute of the Communist Party of Ukraine]. CPU website</ref>\n\n===Decision
        on early elections===\nOn June 17, 1993 the parliament decided to conduct
        on September 26, 1993 a consultative referendum on no confidence in president
        and parliament. However on September 24 the referendum was canceled. The [[Verkhovna
        Rada]] decided to conduct an early elections to parliament on March 27, 1994
        and president on June 26, 1994.\n\nThe presidential elections became the first
        to demonstrate the division of the country on the \"East\" and \"West\".\n\n==Other==\nThey
        were also the first presidential election in the [[Commonwealth of Independent
        States]] where the incumbent head of state, with roots based in the [[Soviet
        Union|Soviet]]-time government elite, lost a democratic election and stepped
        aside.\n\n==Results==\n{| class=wikitable style=text-align:right\n!rowspan=2|Candidate\n!rowspan=2|Party\n!colspan=2|First

        Oliynyk and Tkachenko withdrew from the election campaign.\n\n===Kaniv four===\nSince
        the summer of 1999 there was a sharp competition among the candidates. Four
        candidates [[Yevhen Marchuk]], [[Oleksandr Moroz]], [[Volodymyr Oliynyk]]
        (mayor of [[Cherkasy]]), and [[Oleksandr Tkachenko (politician)|Oleksandr
        Tkachenko]] (speaker of [[Verkhovna Rada]]) met in [[Kaniv]] and called on
        all candidates to just and honest elections. The \"Kaniv Four\" had intentions
        to present a single candidate who would have more chances for success. It
        however failed to do so and no one else joined them neither. [[Volodymyr Oliynyk]]
        being promoted by [[Kirovohrad]] city residents, on October 27 surrendered
        his candidacy in favor of [[Yevhen Marchuk]], while [[Oleksandr Tkachenko
        (politician)|Oleksandr Tkachenko]] favored [[Petro Symonenko]] (leader of
        [[Communist Party of Ukraine]]).\n\n==Results==\nIn the first round the most
        oblasts and the out-of-country district were won by Leonid Kuchma. In seven
        oblasts the top candidate was Petro Symonenko mostly in the centre and south.
        Oleksandr Moroz managed to become the leader in the more agrarian oriented
        [[Poltava Oblast|Poltava]] and [[Vinnytsia Oblast]]s. Nataliya Vitrenko took
        the peak of the candidate list in the [[Sumy Oblast]].\n\n{| class=wikitable

        election, 2004'''''' was held on October 31, November 21 and December 26,
        2004. The election was the fourth [[President of Ukraine|presidential]] election
        to take place in [[Ukraine]] following independence from the [[Soviet Union]].
        The last stages of the election were contested between the [[Our Ukraine (political
        party)|opposition leader]] [[Viktor Yushchenko]] and the incumbent [[Prime
        Minister of Ukraine|Prime Minister]] [[Viktor Yanukovych]] from the [[Party
        of Regions]]. The election was held in a highly charged political atmosphere,
        with allegations of media bias, [[voter intimidation]] and a poisoning of
        candidate Yushchenko with [[Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins|dioxin]].<ref>{{en

        a [[two-round system]] is used to elect the President in which a candidate
        must win a majority (50% or more) of all ballots cast. The first round of
        voting was held on October 31, 2004. As no candidate had 50% or more of the
        votes cast a run-off ballot between the two-highest polling candidates, Viktor
        Yushchenko and Viktor Yanukovych, was held on November 21. According to official
        [[Central Election Commission of Ukraine|Central Election Commission]] results
        announced on November 23, the run-off election was won by Viktor Yanukovych.
        The election results were challenged by Viktor Yushchenko and his supporters
        with many international observers claiming that the election was rigged.<ref

        was held on October 31, 2004. The official results recorded Viktor Yushchenko
        with 39.87 percent and Victor Yanukovych 39.32 percent of the votes cast.
        As no candidate had secured 50% or more votes required for outright victory,
        a [[run-off election]] was scheduled for November 21. Although a 75 percent
        turnout was recorded in the initial vote, observers reported many irregularities,
        particularly in the regions where Yushchenko''s support was seen to be strongest.<ref

        November 21 run-off ballot, Ukraine''s electoral commission declared Prime
        Minister Viktor Yanukovych with 49.42% of the vote the winner with Viktor
        Yushchenko receiving 46.69% of the ballots cast.<ref>http://www.cvk.gov.ua/postanovy/2004/p1265_2004_d.htm</ref>
        [[Observers for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe]]
        (OSCE) said the run-off vote \"did not meet international standards\" and
        U.S. senior election observer, Senator [[Richard Lugar]], called it a \"concerted
        and forceful program of election day fraud\".\n\nThe geographic distribution
        of the votes showed a clear east-west division of Ukraine, which is rooted
        deeply in the [[History of Ukraine|country''s history]]. The western and central
        parts roughly correspond with the former territories of the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian
        Commonwealth]] in the 17th century. They are considered more pro-Western,
        with the population mostly [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]]-speaking and [[Ukrainian
        Greek Catholic]] (Uniate) in the west or [[Ukrainian Orthodox]] in the center,
        and have voted predominantly for Yushchenko. The heavy-industrialized eastern
        part, including the [[Crimea|Autonomous Republic of Crimea]], where the links
        with [[Russia]] and the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] are much stronger, and
        which contains many ethnic Russians, is a Yanukovych stronghold.\n\nBetween
        the two rounds of the election, dramatic increases in turnout were recorded
        in Yanukovych-supporting regions, while Yushchenko-supporting regions recorded
        the same turnout or lower than recorded in the first round. This effect was
        most marked in eastern Ukraine and especially in Yanukovych''s stronghold
        of [[Donetsk Oblast]], where a turnout of 98.5% was reportedly claimed\u2014more
        than 40% up from the first round.<ref name=CEforIP /><ref name=Wilson /> In
        some districts, turnout was recorded to be more than 100% than the previous
        ballot, with one district reported by observers to have recorded a 127% turnout.<ref
        name=CEforIP /><ref name=Wilson /> According to election observers and post-election
        investigations, pro-Yanukovych activists traveled around the country and voted
        many times as absentees.<ref name=CEforIP /><ref name=Wilson /> Some groups
        dependent on government assistance, such as students, hospital patients and
        prisoners, were told to vote for the government candidate.<ref>[http://www.smh.com.au/news/World/Invisible-ink-how-they-rigged-the-vote/2004/12/02/1101923247133.html

        (December 2, 2004)</ref>\n\nMany other alleged irregularities were reported,
        including [[ballot stuffing]], intimidation at voting booths and huge numbers
        of new voters appearing on the electoral rolls\u2014in [[Donetsk]] alone,
        half a million more voters were registered for the runoff election. Yanukovych
        won all but one of the regions where significant increases in turnout were
        noted. It was later determined by the [[Supreme Court of Ukraine|Ukrainian
        Supreme Court]] that this was in fact due to widespread falsification of the
        results.<ref name=CEforIP /><ref name=Wilson />\n\n==International influence
        and reaction==\n\nMany commentators saw the elections as being influenced
        by outside powers, notably the [[United States]], the [[European Union]] and
        [[Russia]], with the US and EU backing Yushchenko ([[United States Secretary
        of State|Secretary of State]] [[Henry Kissinger]], former [[National Security
        Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]] [[Zbigniew Brzezinski]]
        and [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[John McCain]] all visited Kiev, in
        official or private capacities {{citation needed|date=November 2015}}), and
        Russian president [[Vladimir Putin]] publicly backing Yanukovych. In the media
        the two candidates were contrasted, with Yushchenko representing both the
        pro-Western [[Kiev]] residents as well as the rural Ukrainians, whereas Yanukovych
        representing the Eastern, pro-Russian industrial laborers.<ref name=CEforIP/><ref
        name=Wilson/>\n\nMore specifically it was considered that a Yushchenko victory
        would represent a halt of Ukraine''s integration with the rest of the [[Commonwealth
        of Independent States]], and possibly a cancellation of the [[Eurasian Economic
        Community#Common Economic Space|Common Economic Space]] between Russia, Ukraine,
        [[Belarus]] and [[Kazakhstan]] that had already been agreed to by the Ukrainian
        parliament; he would instead be likely to increase attempts at further integration
        with Europe and a possible membership in the EU and NATO. Viktor Yanukovych
        had promised to make Russian an official language for Ukraine, as is also
        the case in other CIS member states Belarus, Kazakhstan and [[Kyrgyzstan]].\n\n===European
        Union===\n[[Image:Ukrainian Round Table 2004.jpg|thumb|225px|Round table talks
        with Ukrainian and foreign representatives during the [[Orange Revolution]]
        on December 1 in [[Kiev]].]]\n\nThe [[European Union]] made it clear that
        they would not recognize the results of the election. All 25 member countries
        of the EU summoned their ambassadors from Ukraine in order to register a sharp
        protest against what is seen as election fraud.<ref>[http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do;jsessionid=335ED3B0E938A20E30BDED4B98B2B687.node1?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+TA+P6-TA-2004-0046+0+DOC+XML+V0//EN
        European Parliament resolution on the forthcoming presidential elections in
        Ukraine], [[The European Parliament]] (October 28, 2004)</ref>\n\nThe [[European
        Union]] disputed the election process in Ukraine, with [[European Commission]]
        [[President of the European Commission|President]] [[Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso]]
        warning of consequences if there is no review of the election. During a meeting
        between Putin and EU officials in [[the Hague]], the Russian president opposed
        the EU reaction by saying that he was \"deeply convinced that we have no moral
        right to push a big European state to any kind of massive disorder.\"\n\nAmong
        EU member states, Ukraine''s western neighbors were most concerned. In [[Poland]],
        Ukraine''s largest western neighbor, politicians, the media and ordinary citizens
        enthusiastically supported Yushchenko and opposed the election fraud. Polish
        deputies to the [[European Parliament]] have called for giving Ukraine the
        prospect of future EU membership provided the country obeyed democratic standards.
        Western EU members are however more reluctant with the idea of Ukrainian membership
        in the EU, which results in Polish media accusing them of being more interested
        in the integration process with [[Turkey]] and maintaining good relations
        with Russia.\n\nOn November 25, former Ukrainian foreign minister and a close
        collaborator of Yushchenko, [[Borys Tarasyuk]] delivered a speech before the
        Polish [[Sejm]], urging Poland not to recognize the election result and help
        solve the political crisis. On the same day former Polish President [[Lech
        Wa\u0142\u0119sa]] went to Kiev to publicly express his support for Viktor
        Yushchenko. He was later followed by a number of Polish MPs from different
        parties.\n\nOn November 26 the [[President of Poland]] [[Aleksander Kwa\u015bniewski]]
        arrived in Kiev, followed on the same day by the [[Union Minister for Foreign
        Affairs|EU Minister for Foreign Affairs]] [[Javier Solana]] and the Lithuanian
        president [[Valdas Adamkus]].\n\n===United States===\n\nThe [[United States
        government]] also decided not to recognize the election, and expressed dissatisfaction
        with the results; the outgoing [[United States Secretary of State|US Secretary
        of State]], [[Colin Powell]], quite unequivocally stated that the result announced
        could not be accepted as legitimate by the [[United States]]. [[President
        of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush]] and various members of
        [[United States Congress|Congress]] made statements disclosing their concern
        over the legitimacy of the polling. Prominent former [[Cold War]] hawk [[Zbigniew
        Brzezinski]] cast the election as an opposition to renewed [[Imperial Russia|Russian
        imperialism]]:\n\n{{cquote|Russia is more likely to make a break with its
        imperial past if the newly independent post-Soviet states are vital and stable.
        Their vitality will temper any residual Russian imperial temptations. Political
        and economic support for the new states must be an integral part of a broader
        strategy for integrating Russia into a cooperative transcontinental system.
        A [[Sovereignty|sovereign]] Ukraine is a critically important component of
        such a policy, as is support for such strategically pivotal states as [[Azerbaijan]]

        traditionally occurred in October.\n\nAccording to the [[s:Constitution of
        Ukraine#Article 103|Constitution of Ukraine]], regular elections of the President
        of Ukraine are held on the last Sunday of the last month of the fifth year
        of the term of authority of the President of Ukraine. In the event of pre-term
        termination of authority of the President of Ukraine, elections of the President
        of Ukraine are held within ninety days from the day of termination of the
        authority.\n\nEarly Presidential elections can be held in case of presidential
        resignation, ill-health, [[impeachment]] or death.\n\nThe President of Ukraine
        is elected by the citizens of Ukraine for a five-year term, on the basis of
        universal, equal and direct suffrage, by secret ballot.\n\nA candidate seeking
        election must be a citizen of Ukraine who has attained the age of thirty-five,
        has the right to vote, has resided in Ukraine for the past ten years prior
        to the day of elections, and has command of the state language as required

        date for the first round of voting. Within a week, President Yushchenko filed
        an appeal with the Constitutional Court against Verkhovna Rada''s October
        25 date. The President''s appeal argued that his inauguration on January 23,
        2005, was the commencement of his five-year term of office and as such the
        next presidential election must be set for the last Sunday before January
        23, 2010, in accordance with Article 103.<ref>[http://www.unian.net/eng/news/news-310155.html

        secretary under Viktor Yushchenko stated:\n\n:\"Alarming declarations about
        the likely vote rigging directly point to organizational weaknesses of some
        candidates as the law allows for reliable barriers against any electoral fraud.
        For instance, any presidential candidate can send his two representatives
        to sit on local and regional electoral commissions, appoint observers to keep
        an eye on voting and counting of ballots. Proxies of candidates who have wide
        authority can also supervise the course of the voting\". \"There are more
        than enough supervisory tools. Other effective barriers to electoral fraud
        are the Central Election Commission [whose members are appointed by major
        parliamentary parties on a quota principle] and numerous international observers.
        Mass media and NGOs, notably, the Committee of Voters of Ukraine, will also
        be effective in helping to curb fraud. Of great importance for establishing
        the final tally are also exit polls run by respected polling companies.they
        will all be used during the campaign.\" adding that \"All the more so that
        there are 18 presidential candidates, some having considerable weight. That
        is why any declarations about the likely fraud are just attempts to justify
        a defeat of those who make them. Note that those candidates who are selling
        themselves as strong-willed and tough are most given to such declarations.
        In fact, such declarations expose them as would-be losers and outsiders\"<ref>[http://zik.com.ua/en/news/2009/11/24/205864

        a Ukrainian [[vyshyvanka]] with a wreath (a 1916 postcard)]]\nThe ''''''Ukrainian
        wreath'''''' ({{lang-uk|\u0432\u0456\u043d\u043e\u043a}}, ''''vinok'''') is
        a type of [[Wreath (attire)|wreath]] which, in traditional [[Ukrainian culture]],
        is worn by girls and young unmarried women.  The wreath may be part of a tradition
        dating back to the old [[East Slavs|East Slavic]] customs that predate the
        [[Christianization of Rus]].<ref name=vinok>Orysia Paszczak Tracz, [http://www.ukrweekly.com/Archive/1999/319917.shtml
        Vinok, vinochok], ''''[[The Ukrainian Weekly]]'''', August 1, 1999.</ref>
        The flower wreath remains a part of the Ukrainian national attire, and is
        worn on festive occasions and on [[holy days]] and since the [[2014 Ukrainian
        revolution]] increasingly in daily life.<ref name=ufcvf16>[http://www.vogue.com/13395822/ukraine-flower-crown-vinok-trend/
        In Ukraine, That Flower Crown Means More Than You Think], [[Vogue.com|Vogue]]
        (FEBRUARY 5, 2016)</ref>\n\n== History ==\nOn the [[Ivan Kupala Day|day of
        Ivan Kupala]], young women placed their wreaths in the water with a lit-up
        candle, foretelling their romantic future by how the wreath flowed down the
        river or lake.  From the wreath''s direction, the girl could tell whom she
        would marry:  if the wreath stayed in one spot and did not float down the
        water, she would not marry; if it went under, she would die; if the candle
        went out, misfortune would follow. The young men would dive into the water,
        trying to retrieve the vinok of the girl each loved. One of the ritual Kupala
        songs says, \"Who will catch the wreath will catch the girl, who will get
        the wreath will become mine.\"<ref name=vinok/>  It dates back to pre-Christian
        times when it was thought that the headdress would protect girls from evil
        spirits.  The ceremonial, religious value diminished, and was later replaced
        as a national character of girlhood: to lose a wreath in folk songs and traditions
        means for a maiden to transition into womanhood.<ref name=vinok/>\n\nIn his
        book ''''[[The Golden Bough]]'''', mythology scholar [[James George Frazer]]
        first claimed that Ivan Kupala Day ([[John the Baptist]] Day), celebrated
        in Ukraine and [[Russia]] shortly after the summer [[solstice]], and closely
        associated with the wreath in Ukraine, was in fact originally a pagan fertility
        rite.\n\n== Appearance and construction ==\n\nLike most Ukrainian [[folk culture|folk]]
        dress, the ''''vinok'''' had significant symbolic value and only specific
        flowers were used.<ref>[http://needlib.com/pokaz_st.php?id=205 \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435
        \u043d\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u043a\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044e\u043c\u044b
        \u0416\u0435\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u0433\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432\u043d\u044b\u0435
        \u0443\u0431\u043e\u0440\u044b]</ref>  It was traditionally worn by girls
        who were eligible for marriage.  The wreath''s name, ''''vinok'''', is related
        to the Ukrainian word for a wedding ceremony ''''vinchannya''''.  \n\nThe
        flowers used to make the wreath were generally fresh, paper or waxen and were
        attached onto a band of stiff paper backing covered with a [[ribbon]].  \n\nThe
        wreath varied in many of the regions of Ukraine; young women throughout the
        country wore various headdresses of yarn, ribbon, coins, feathers and grasses,
        but these all had the same symbolic meaning.  In parts of [[Dnieper Ukraine|central]]
        and [[eastern Ukraine]] the flowers were raised in the center front.  Usually
        multicolored, embroidered ribbons were attached to the back.<ref name=vinok/>\n\nDuring
        the Ukrainian wedding ceremony, the vinok was replaced by the [[ochipok]],
        a cap that she would wear for the rest of her life.\n\nThe wreath is now worn
        by traditional [[Ukrainian dance]]rs.\n\n== Neopaganism ==\nFollowers of the
        modern movement of [[Slavic Neopaganism]] attach a mystical significance to
        the wreath, weaving their wreaths of oak leaves and field flowers for their
        ritual celebration of the [[Summer Solstice]].<ref name=5tv>[http://www.toukraine.info/EN/NEWS/SITE/2682

        currency sign]]\nThe hryvnia sign is a [[cursive]] [[Ukrainian alphabet|Ukrainian
        Cyrilic letter]] [[He (Cyrillic)|He]] (''''\u0433''''), or a mirrored letter
        S, with a double horizontal stroke, symbolizing stability, similar to that
        used in other currency symbols such as \u00a5 or \u20ac. Hryvnia is abbreviated
        \"\u0433\u0440\u043d\" (hrn) in Ukrainian. The hryvnia sign \u20b4 was released
        in March 2004. The specific design of the hryvnia sign was a result of a public
        contest held by [[National Bank of Ukraine]] in 2003. The bank announced that
        it would not take any special steps of promoting the sign, but expressed expectations
        that the recognition and the technical possibilities of rendering the sign
        would follow. As soon as the sign was announced, a proposal to encode it was
        written. The sign was Unicode encoded as {{unichar|20B4|HRYVNIA SIGN|html=}}
