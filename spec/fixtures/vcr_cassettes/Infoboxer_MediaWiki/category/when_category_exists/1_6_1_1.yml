        has taken a part in many Ukrainian festivals (e.g. Rujnacija, Rock-Vybux,
        Taras Buljba, Metal Heads Mission, Big Alternative Gig, Fort.Missia).\n\nThe
        band ceased to exist in February 2013 because of conflict between Viktor Novosyolov
        and the rest of the band. Later Novosyolov created a project [[Kompas (band)|Kompas]]

        ({{lang-uk|\u0413\u0430\u0434\u0438}}) is a Ukrainian rock band from [[Lviv]],
        one of the most successful Ukrainian bands of [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] times.
        The band''s musical style combines different genres such as rock''n''roll,
        blues, punk, reggae, funk and folk. Ironic song lyrics contain a lot of local
        vernacularisms, slang and [[surzhyk]]. The name translates as \"Hadyukin Brothers\",
        where the fictional last name Hadyukin is derived from the word ''''hadyuka'''',
        or \"[[Viperidae|viper]]\". The abbreviation literally means \"[[snake]]s\"
        (In Ukrainian the two words are [[cognate]]s.)\n\nThe band was active mainly
        between 1988 and 1996. In January 2006 they held a big solo concert in [[Kyiv]]
        which was a big event in Ukrainian media space and was visited by a lot of
        famous people (including [[Yulia Tymoshenko] the prime minister at the time]).
        After the band''s leader Serhiy Kuzminskyi died in 2009 a big tribute concert
        was held in 2011, joined by prominent Ukrainian rock musicians such as [[Komu
        Vnyz]], [[Vopli Vidoplyasova]], [[Okean Elzy]] and others. In 2014 the rest
        of the band members released a new album (the first one since 1996). \n\n==

        after the famous character, [[Aeneas]], from one of the [[Ivan Kotlyarevsky#The
        first modern Ukrainian writer|literal works]] of [[Ivan Kotlyarevsky]].\n\n==History==\nDuring
        the 1960s Students from the Kievan special music school formed a band named
        after Ukrainian composer [[Mykola Lysenko]]. They initially played unique
        interpretations of Ukrainian folk songs. Later its members were exposed to
        the late works of [[The Beatles]] and started to rearrange works of [[Johann
        Sebastian Bach|Bach]] and [[Khachaturian]]. In 1971 the band split as Petrynenko
        and Blinov left it to form the new band called ''''Dzvony''''. The band started
        to experiment in new genres: blues and soul. In 1972 the band and their music
        where banned in the Soviet Union and labeled \"bourgeois-national\". As a
        result, all existing records and recordings were destroyed. After that the
        band went underground until 1974. The members then merged with ''''Dzvony''''
        into the new vocal-instrumental ensemble ''''Decorative Trails''''. After
        the band was accepted to the ''''Ukr-kontsert'''' it changed its name to ''''Hrono''''.
        In 1977 the ensemble became known as ''''Eney'''' once again. After a period
        of time, ''''Eney'''' broke up and its members either joined different bands
        or went solo. [[Taras Petrynenko|Petrynenko]] later created his own band [[Hrono]].\n\n==External

        is a [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] [[folk rock]] band formed in 1991. The music of
        Haydamaky is inspired by various [[ethnic music]] from around the world, especially
        from various regions of Ukraine, such as [[Polesia]], [[Bukovina]], and [[Carpathian
        Ruthenia|Transcarpathia]]. Other influences include the Romanian folklore,
        [[punk rock|punk music]] sound of [[Shane MacGowan]] and by the [[reggae]]
        of such bands like [[Burning Spear]] and [[Black Uhuru]].\n\n== History ==\nThe
        Haydamaky began their career in 1991, shortly after [[Ukraine]] declared its
        independence from the [[Soviet Union]]. Then the band was known as Aktus,
        and played mostly local gigs in the underground [[Kyiv]] music scene. Without
        a fertile, popular local music scene, Aktus turned to the sounds of [[reggae]],
        [[ska]], and [[punk music]] for a fresh alternative. Members of the band were
        also attracted to the political impact that these genres had on their society.
        The idea was that through music significant social change could be possible.
        This gave a greater purpose to the performance of such musical styles. The
        discovery of these musical genres later became the key to their own realization
        of a specifically Ukrainian musical style. Haydamaky''s hope is to forge an
        inherently [[Music of Ukraine|Ukrainian popular music]] style, which looks
        back to its own heritage and traditions as a source for inspiration.\n\nWith
        the addition of [[sopilka]]-[[vocal]]ist [[Oleksandr Yarmola]] and [[accordion]]ists
        [[Ivan Lenyo]], both known and respected in folk circles, the band increasingly
        incorporated elements of Ukrainian [[folk music]] into their compositions.\n\nDuring
        the early 1990s Aktus has engaged in constant touring of Europe. Unlike most
        popular Ukrainian music groups who propagate Soviet style [[Estrada]], Aktus
        sought to introduce elements of Ukrainian folk music through a cross-cultural
        mix including Reggae and Ska.\n\n[[EMI|EMI international records]] of London
        discovered the group in [[Kyiv]] in early 2001. Akta signed  immediately to
        their label. At that time the band realized it was time to establish a stronger
        tie to their own culture. They changed their name to ''''Haydamaky'''', in
        honor of the eighteenth-century [[Haydamak rebellion]] against the Polish
        [[szlachta]].\n\nDuring the last years the band has participated in various
        festivals such as:          \n* TFF Rudolstadt \u2013 2003 ([[Germany]]) \n*
        \"Litom\u011b\u0159ick\u00fd ko\u0159en\" \u2013 2002, 2003 ([[Czech Republic]])\n*
        \"[[Viljandi Folk Festival|Viljandi Folk]]\" \u2013 2003 ([[Estonia]])\n*
        \"Sziget\" festival \u2013 2009 in [[Budapest]] ([[Hungary]]) \n* \"Pohoda\"
        festival \u2013 2001, 2002 in [[Tren\u010d\u00edn]] \n* \"Huntenpop\" \u2013
        2008 ([[Netherlands]])\n* \"Tilburg Mundial\" \u2013 2007 ([[Netherlands]])\n*
        \"Amsterdamm Roots\" \u2013 2007 ([[Netherlands]])\n* \"Volt Festival\" \u2013
        2010 ([[Hungary]]), just to name a few.\n\nHaydamaky have recently performed
        at many club venues across Europe, including as a special guest at a concert
        of [[Asian Dub Foundation]] in Bratislava, Slovakia. Other club appearances
        this year were held in [[Germany]], [[Estonia]], [[Poland]], [[Czech Republic]],
        [[Slovakia]], and [[Moscow]].\n \nIn April 2004 the band released their second
        album \"[[Bohuslav (album)|Bohuslav]]\". This time the group searched even
        deeper into Ukrainian folk music for material, ideas, and textures. The ensemble
        has invited [[violin]]ist [[Vasyl Hekker]], perhaps the foremost authority
        on authentic Ukrainian folk [[violin]] style, to collaborate on the project.
        [[Banduryst]]-Guitarist [[Jurij Fedynskyj]], of [[New York City]] has relocated
        to [[Kyiv]] to join the ensemble. Also Ukrainian freestyle banduryst [[Roman
        Hrynkiv]] participated. And the band invited two young ladies from authentic
        Ukrainian choir \"[[Bozhychi]]\": Natalia Serbina and Masha Firsova, to do
        the back \u2013 vocals on the most of songs of the album. The \"Bohuslav\"
        promo is just on. In June Haydamaky are off on a  huge concert tour, which
        starts by their concert in \"Mazepa Fest\" ([[Poltava]], Ukraine) and will
        continue through the summer in [[Estonia]], [[Poland]], [[Czech Republic]],
        [[Slovakia]] and [[Romania]].\n\nIn October 2006 at the [http://www.womex.com/
        WOMEX] World Music Expo held in Seville Spain, Haydamaky''s release of their
        CD entitled ''''[[Ukraine Calling (album)|Ukraine Calling]]'''' released by

        2009}}\n\n''''''JetRockers'''''' is an [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] [[hard rock]]
        and [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band from [[Lviv]], [[Ukraine]]. The
        band was founded in 2007. Best known JetRockers'' performance is a first [[open-air
        concert]] in 2007, second in 2008 and third in 2009, all in [[Lviv]].\n\n==History==\nJetRockers
        were founded by Vasyl Mylko and Serhiy Otroshchenko. The very beginnings start
        out in 2007 in [[Lviv]], at [[software]] company [[SoftServe]], when Vasyl
        Mylko, Strategic Business Unit (SBU) Manager of JetLab, was interviewing Serhiy
        Otroshchenko. Serhiy was a [[SoftServe]] University graduate, while JetLab
        lacked resources. So during the interview Vasyl asked if Serhiy played some
        instruments or at least painted. Serhiy answered affirmative. It happened
        that Vasyl had an [[electric guitar]] and an [[amplifier]] in the office,
        so they were given to the interviewee for some performance. Serhiy played
        something from [[Kreator]] and [[Malmsteen]] and thus was hired to JetLab.
        The band name was invented to be JetRockers. There was an idea that all JetRockers
        members had to be from the same JetLab team. It was so till 2008.\n\nBass
        guitar, Roman Bilusiak, joined the band soon, he is from musicians family.
        Vitaliy Topolnytskyy joined as a drummer. In Summer 2007 JetLab team went
        to [[Shatsky ozera]] for [[barbecue]], JetRockers took all the gear. There
        was first big sound check and the casting for vocals. Khrystyna Kosyk succeeded
        as a singer of [[Rock music|rock]] compositions, Vyacheslav Dyak was selected
        for [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] and [[punk rock]] songs. It is supposed
        that band played successfully, which was confirmed by the random listeners
        from the recreation area [[Shatsky ozera]]. [[Rehearsal]] delayed till the
        late night. Then new drummer was invited, Ivan Lutsyk. Interesting fact is
        that Vasyl Mylko got references to him from Roman Figel from JetLab, and found
        Ivan in the corporate gym, training [[judo]]. Ivan agreed to join JetRockers
        if Vasyl buys the drums. Vasyl bought [[Sonor]] drums, Ivan joined instantly.
        Then Galyna Stasiuk joined the band for vocals. This staff performed in 2007
        and had big success locally.\n\nLater in 2007 drummer Ivan Lutsyk decided
        to leave the band as he wanted to develop as a guitar player. Vyacheslav Dyak
        proposed his colleague drummer Mykola Glibovych. Vasyl interviewed Mykola
        in summer 2007 with intention to hire to JetLab SBU. Of course, Mykola had
        to play the drums right in the office just after the interview, and most of
        present people were surprised that Mykola played so loud. But it was negotiated
        that Mykola would be ready after the training in [[SoftServe]] University,
        so he joined the band in February 2008.\n\nThen was a time of vocals rotations.
        Olena Strelchenko used to sing for a while. Eventually JetRockers welcomed
        Olga Didukh (then she changed her last name to Moroz after her husband). Oleksandr
        Sukholeyster joined JetRockers as keyboards player. This staff played in 2008
        and achieved even better appreciation because of higher quality of both sound
        and performance.\n\nJetRockers plays on [[SoftServe]] Company Day. It is annual
        celebration that takes place in Buhta Vikingiv resort, ~20 kilometers from
        [[Lviv]]. In 2007 JetRockers played as the opener for the famous [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]]
        band [[Tartak]] in front of more than 1000 people. In 2008 JetRockers played
        as the opener for another [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] headliner [[Skryabin (band)|Skryabin]].
        JetRockers did not play in 2009 due to the different place of company day
        celebration, hence unavailability of the big scene for the planned performance.
        There are opinions that it was linked to the [[Economic crisis of 2008]].\n\nRecent
        considerable performance took place at Millennium night club in [[Lviv]] on
        December 26, 2009. Current line-up includes new drummer Rustam Iskandarov
        (he also plays in Black Jack) and bass player Andriy Savchyn (he also plays
        in Fayno).\n\n==Discography==\n2007 - AoJaJeNA <br/>\n2008 - Punk Rock over

        Komu Vnyz''s music is a blend of gothic and industrial styles, combined with
        the lyrics of ancient Ukrainian legends. As of 2011, the last ten years Komu
        Vnyz have released two albums, have been recognized{{Who|date=July 2011}}
        as the cult Ukrainian band and, got the status of \"the Fathers of the Ukrainian
        [[Gothic rock|Gothic]]\".{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}\n\n== History
        ==\nKomu Vnyz got its start in the year 1988. Unknown young actor [[Andriy
        Sereda]] and educator [[Volodyslav Makarov]] worked together in the same theater.
        Sereda and Makarov joined with three more artists ([[Serhiy Stepanenko]],
        [[Yevhen Razin]], [[Volodyslav Maliuhin]]) to make Komu Vnyz. They wound up
        at their first festival [[Chervona Ruta (festival)|Chervona Ruta]] completely
        by chance. It was too late to submit the sample recording to the panel of
        judges for the tryout, but [[Taras Petrynenko]], after listening to their
        work, insisted that they participated in the event. They received second place.{{Citation
        needed|date=July 2011}}\n\nAfter releasing their first album \"[[Padaya Vverkh
        (album)|Padaya Vverkh]]\" (\"Falling Up\"), Komu Vnyz and the rest of the
        Chervona Ruta winners toured in [[Canada]], [[Poland]], and many Ukrainian
        cities. After their tour, Komu Vnyz started work on their next album. All
        of the band members quit their day jobs to focus more of their time on music.\n\nFrom
        1996 onward, Komu Vnyz came out from the precipice of financial difficulties.
        Playbills started to appear railings and fences in [[Kiev]] for their 1997
        concert, In Kastus, named for one of their [[In Kastus (album)|albums]].\n\nIn
        2000 the band played at Ivan Franko theater, performing a concert dedicated
        to the memory of 300 young students killed under [[Kruty]]. They also headlined
        at the first Ukrainian gothic festival, \"[[Dity Nochi]]\" (\"Children of
        the Night\"), organized by [[Ukrainian Gothic Portal]], and started to work
        with UGP. In 2002 the band played on the biggest{{Citation needed|date=July
        2011}} European gothic festival, [[Wave Gotik Treffen]].<ref>http://www.wave-gotik-treffen.de/english/past.php?reqYear=2002</ref>\n\nIn
        2004 the musicians were invited to perform at Wave Gotik Treffen once again.
        More than 1500 people attended{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}.\n\nToday
        Komu Vnyz is well known not only in Ukraine but abroad as well.{{Citation
        needed|date=July 2011}} Some{{Who|date=July 2011}} consider the band to be
        founders of a new musical style in Ukraine: the Ukrainian Gothic.\n\nAs of
        2011, Komu Vnyz is translating their lyrics into [[English language|English]]
        in order to re-release their albums in Europe. Their new album \"[[IDEM]]\"

        (from the [[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''''The [[colorado potato beetle]]s'''',
        also known as ''''The Colorados'''') is a [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] band formed
        in 2006 in [[Ternopil]]. The band play their own songs, but have also covered
        several popular and folk songs. ''''Los Colorados'''' increased in prominence
        after their cover of [[Katy Perry]]''s song \"[[Hot n Cold]]\" grew popular
        via online video websites. The band plays [[guitar]], [[bayan (accordion)|bayan]],
        [[bass guitar]] and [[drums]].\n\n== History ==\nThe band was formed in the
        city of [[Ternopil]] in 2006 and originally performed their own songs. However,
        their popularity came when they were invited to a local TV station to perform
        live, where they played several songs, among them [[Katy Perry]]''s song \"[[Hot
        n Cold]]\". The lead singer didn''t speak any English and learned the song
        from a text transliterated into Ukrainian letters.<ref name=\"BBC\">[http://www.bbc.co.uk/ukrainian/entertainment/story/2009/06/090618_los_colorados_sp.shtml
        BBC Ukrainian: Ternopil conquers the Internet] (Ukrainian)</ref>\n\nThe peak
        of popularity occurred when their version of ''''Hot n Cold'''' was aired
        on [[The Ellen DeGeneres Show]]. The video posted on [[YouTube]] was viewed
        more than 3 and a half million times and received generally positive reviews
        because of its comic value and unusual interpretation. Katy Perry herself
        described this version of her song as \"inspiring.\"<ref>[http://katyperryblog.tumblr.com/post/88968953/inspiring
        Katy Perry''s blog]</ref>\n\nDuring their performances members of the group
        present themselves as the \"boys from the village of Tetylkivtsi\", a real
        village (population \u2014 636), however, in reality most of the performers
        come from the city of Ternopil.<ref name=\"BBC\"/>\n\n== Songs by ''''Los

        was a [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] music band from [[Kharkiv]]. The band''s style
        joins [[acid jazz]], [[Lounge music|lounge]] and [[rock music|rock]]. In their
        texts musicians used mostly Ukrainian, Russian and French. \n\nLuk was formed
        in 1999. The name was given accidentally without special meaning (''''\u043b\u044e\u043a''''
        means ''''manhole''''). After released four studio albums Luk declared its
        break up in 2011.\n\nLuk collaborated with Kharkiv-based Ukrainian writer
        [[Serhiy Zhadan]]. Most of their Ukrainian-language songs were witten in lyrics
        of Zhadan (in particular the first album ''''Tourist zone'''' is based on
        Zhadan''s play \"Merry Christmas, Jesus Christ\"). Also Luk recorded a lot
        of songs with [[5''Nizza]] member [[Andriy Zaporozhets]] (in particular the
        second album is a result of collaboration with Zaporozhets). Their third album
        contains two songs recorded with other 5''Nizza musician [[Serhiy Babkin]].\n\n==

        is a [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] band from [[Kiev]], [[Ukraine]]\n\n== History ==\n\n===Mad
        Heads===\nBand called [[Mad Heads]] was formed in [[Kiev]], [[Ukraine]] by
        Vadym Krasnooky. In Ukraine they enjoyed the status of a rock legend for many
        years, with 4 studio albums, good press, frequent TV appearances and constant
        live touring. They have also been acknowledged internationally, as a well-known
        band in the [[psychobilly]] scene across the world and #1 of the genre in
        the whole Eastern Europe.\n\nIt took time and a few line up changes before
        Mad Heads became a band able to succeed with such a hard task, but since they
        were ready there was nothing to stop them. Their debut album \u201c''''[[Psycholula]]''''\u201d
        was out in 1996 on Crazy Love Records in Germany, while in [[Ukraine]] they
        were already a well known band: seen on TV, heard on radio, talked about in
        major press. They filmed a video to support their album, and it was actually
        rotated on the channel of national importance.\n\nSoon after, Mad Heads started
        to tour abroad. They appeared 4 times at Rock\u2019n\u2019Roll Jamboree in
        [[Finland]], 3 times at [[Calella Psychobilly Meeting]] in Spain, they rocked
        the halls of many festivals and clubs in Russia, Germany, United Kingdom,
        [[Netherlands]], [[Poland]] and Italy. They\u2019ve been invited to the United
        States and only couldn\u2019t make it because of some visa problems. They
        played the same stage with the most of their favorite bands of the scene while
        becoming  the heroes for many younger acts.\n\nThe debut album was followed
        by \u201c''''[[Mad In Ukraine]]''''\u201d in 1998 and \u201c''''[[Naked Flame]]''''\u201d
        in 2002 (both out on Crazy Love Records) which brought the acknowledgment
        for Mad Heads of being #1 band of the scene in Eastern Europe and with no
        doubt an outstanding act of the 90s psychobilly generation. In [[Ukraine]],
        they simply become a rock\u2019n\u2019roll legend, so they decided to do even
        more for their local fans and in 2003 was released the album \u201c''''[[Contact
        (Mad Heads album)|Contact]]''\u201d with all the songs in the mother languages
        (the first 3 albums were in English). This record was out on local EMI licensee
        Comp Music.\n\nIn 2004 the guys felt that their mission was complete. Their
        music was changing throughout the years, and now they had to face the fact
        that it didn\u2019t fit psychobilly scene anymore. So they took it even further,
        doubled the line up with 3-piece brass section and mixed up their older sounds
        with [[ska]] [[Punk rock|punk]] and some Ukrainian folk. The new project called
        ''''''Mad Heads XL'''''' became a smashing success in [[Ukraine]], so it was
        decided to quit as a trio for an indeterminate period.\n\n===Mad Heads XL===\nIn
        the beginning of 2004, the new project Mad Heads XL was born. The line up
        was doubled with the powerful brass section (trumpet, trombone, saxophone)
        and the music drifted in the direction of [[ska]] with a touch of swing and
        Ukrainian folk, becoming something that might come out of [[Manu Chao]], [[Brian
        Setzer]] and [[Emir Kusturica]] jam session.\n\nIn March 2004 it was tested
        in the best live music clubs of Kiev, in April it appeared on top Ukrainian
        TV channels and in May the band came up the stage of the main Ukrainian music
        festival Tavria Games to perform for some 75,000 people (there was also a
        live broadcast on M1 \u2013 the main Ukrainian music TV channel).  That show
        brought the band to 9 more big open air stages in the next few months, with
        the audience varied from 5,000 to 100,000 (Day of Youth on the main Kiev''s
        square, [[Maidan Nezalezhnosti]]), proving that Mad Heads XL could really
        entertain a huge audience. In September 2004 the band was invited to take
        part in Djuice-Drive tour (sport palaces in the 6 biggest cities of Ukraine).
        They were the only Ukrainian act on the bill with artists from Western Europe.
        They also got busy playing in the clubs.\n\nThey were among the first bands
        to support the people of Ukraine in the protest action, when the [[Orange
        Revolution]] started. They canceled any commercial gigs and performed for
        the people on now famous central square of Kiev Maidan Nezalezhnosti, giving
        away their new song for the compilation \"Orange Songs of Ukrainian Revolution\"
        which featured some of the best Ukrainian acts and artists, and the profit
        of which had been transferred to the inhabitants of the protest camping. The
        band never thought of any promotion back then, but there probably was: their
        performance on Maidan was seen on CNN as well as on several European news
        channels.\n\nIn 2005 the band was on the road again and played plenty open
        air stages all over Ukraine. Mad Heads XL also appeared abroad, with a lot
        of success, at Rock for People 2005 festival in Czech Republic, not to mention
        a club tour of Russia.\nIn September 2005 ZYX Music released maxi-CD \u201cNadiya
        Yea\u201d in Germany, but the main events with this song were happening in
        the homeland. The album \u201cNadiya Yea\u201d was released in the end of
        October on Comp Music/EMI, so far in Ukraine only, soon proving to be among
        the bestselling local releases of the year 2005. During 2004\u20132005 years
        the band had several line-up changes.\n\nBeyond Europe, Mad Heads XL have
        performed at Ukrainian festivals in [[Toronto]], Canada in 2010, and [[Dauphin,
        Manitoba]], in 2011.  Commanding a strong fan base in the [[Ukrainian-Canadian]]
        community, they returned to Toronto again in January 2012 performing material
        from their new album ''''\u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043dSKA'''' at a
        zabava on one night and the \"Royal [[Malanka]]\" the following night. For
        both events, Mad Heads XL were joined onstage by Ukrainian violinist Vasyl
        Popadiuk (aka \"Papa Duke\"). Local Ukrainian-Canadian music groups, \"Zapovid\"
        and \"Hudi a Mocni\" opened their shows.\n\n==Current members==\n* Vadym Krasnooky

        is a popular [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] [[folk-rock]], [[blues]], [[ska]] band;
        the band formed in 1998 in [[Kiev]], [[Ukraine]]. The band''s vocalist and
        most recognizable member is [[Serhiy Fomenko|Serhiy \"Foma\" Fomenko]].\n\n==
        Activity ==\n{{Original research|section|date=February 2016}}Mandry were officially
        formed in 1997 by the already well known singer-songwriter [[Serhiy Fomenko|Serhiy
        \"Foma\" Fomenko]], who had made a name for himself in the Kyiv underground
        music scene for his creative work with the group Den'' Vmyraye Rano (Day Dies
        Early). At first they performed as a three-piece acoustic band, but after
        a few band member change-overs a new sound was created which made Mandry the
        spearheads of what is now known as \"folk music of the cities\". They performed
        their first concert with this unique sound on 24 December 1997.\n{{Advert|section|date=February
        2016}}\nIn contemporary Ukrainian youth culture the group hold an original
        musical niche. Owing to the stylish diversity of their music and their unique
        combination of traditional Ukrainian [[folk music]] with modern rhythms, elements
        of city romance and French chansons with a good dose of [[reggae]], [[blues]],
        [[Rock music|rock]] and [[Punk rock|punk]], they manage to captivate a varied
        audience representing all age groups. The music of Mandry, in spite of being
        a combination of various genres, is well crafted and artistically unique.
        Their songs are full of imagery and have emotionally charged melodic patterns
        making poetic lyrics understandable to people from all walks of life. Mandry''s
        repertoire is still growing, expanding not only due to new songs being written
        by the band members, but also by giving traditional folk songs a new interpretation.\n\nIn
        October 1997 accordion player [[Leonid Bieley]] appeared on the scene and
        his contribution to Foma''s songs enriched the melodies, as did a change in
        percussionist. Salman joined the contingent of ''''mandrivnyky'''' (wanderers)
        with a complete set of percussion instruments. At this time Mandry possibly
        were the only Ukrainian band with a percussionist.\n\nIn the same month the
        new line-up played a concert, but it wasn''t a very successful performance,
        and as they were dissatisfied doubts arose as to whether the band should split
        up. The director of Asteroid records came to the band''s rescue and offered
        them their first contract and with his help the group continued.\n\nThe last
        alteration in the group''s line-up occurred when Mandry invited drummer [[Andriy
        Zanko]] and [[Serhiy Chehodayev]], who replaced [[Oleksandr Kokhanivsky]]
        on bass, to join the band. As a result, the sound of the band changed quite
        radically. Their music was enriched with contemporary rhythms and started
        to include [[France|French]] melodic influences.\n\nIn the months that followed
        the group recorded and released their first MC on the Asteroid label. It was
        recorded in a hurry, and thus the quality of the album suffered. Over the
        next year and a half, the material was being constantly reworked.\n\nIn August
        1998 the band produced their first video for the song \"Romansero pro nizhnu
        korolevu\", which quickly won the audience''s approval. In September 1998,
        during the First All-Ukrainian Music Video Contest Mandry''s video was in
        the top three, and director Anton Trofimov was also nominated for an award.\n\nThe
        first EP of the group, which, apart from seven songs also contained the video
        clip \"Romansero pro nizhnu korolevu\", the MC in [[MP3]] format, text information
        in html and a photo gallery, was released in December 1998.\n\nThe same year
        Mandry played in [[Lviv]], [[Dnipropetrivsk]], [[Kherson]], [[Donetsk]], [[Minsk]]
        and their hometown Kyiv.\n\nIn January 1999 they filmed their second video
        to their song \"Kartata Sorochka\" in Lviv, which was broadcast on the national
        TV channel [[1+1 (channel)|1+1]].\n\nAll in all 1999 was a very busy year
        for them with many concerts. In springtime they visited [[Budapest]], the
        capital of [[Hungary]], to take part in a festival commemorating the 50th
        anniversary of the [[European Union|EU]]. In summer they performed at \"[[Rock-Kyiv]]\",
        \"PEPSI-SZIGET\" ([[Budapest]]) and \"[[Slavianski Bazaar in Vitebsk]]\" ([[Vitebsk]])
        festivals. At the end of summer they started working on their video to the
        song \"Rusalky\" ([[Mermaid]]s).\n\nIn April 2000 they released their first
        full-length album ''''Romansero pro nizhnu korolevu'''' on Karavan Records
        and their video to the song \"Rusalky\".\n\nIn June 2000 Mandry took part
        in the International Festival of Ukrainian Culture which takes place in [[Sopot]],
        [[Poland]]. In September they participated at Rock-Existence festival in Kyiv.
        In November they released their EP ''''Rusalky'''' on Karavan Records.\n\nFrom
        14 to 26 May 2001 Mandry had a tour across Poland. In two weeks'' time they
        played 11 concerts in [[Wroc\u0142aw]], [[Warsaw]], [[Krak\u00f3w]], [[Szczecin]],
        [[Gliwice]], [[Bia\u0142ystok]], [[Olsztyn]], [[Sopot]] and [[Lublin]]. At
        the beginning of November 2001 Creon Music, a [[France|French]] record label,
        released a compilation called ''''Ukrainian Rock'''', which included a few
        songs by Mandry.<ref>''''Eastern Folk, Poland Folk Encyclopedia, in Polish''''</ref>\nIn
        March 2002 the video to \"Dochka melnyka\" (Miller''s daughter) was shown
        on Ukrainian television.\n\nOn 19 May 2002 Mandry, together with other Ukrainian
        groups and artists, played a concert at the Hippodrome, in [[London]]. The
        show was part of the Festival of Ukrainian Culture in [[Great Britain]].\n\nAt
        the end of September 2002 their first animated video to the song \"Orysya\"
        was shown on Ukrainian television.\n\nOn 17 October 2002, their second album,
        ''''Legenda pro Ivanka ta Odarku'''', was released in Ukraine on the [[Lavina
        Music]] record label.\n\nOn 17 May 2003, the band took part in the International
        festival \"The Day of United Europe\" in Kyiv. At the end of August 2003 Mandry
        started shooting the video for \"Vitre Tsyhane\" (Gypsy Wind), which was the
        first one to be shown on the all-Ukrainian [[M1 music channel]] that October.\n\n2004
        saw Mandry tour extensively in [[Ukraine]] to support [[Viktor Yushchenko]]''s
        campaign to become the next president of Ukraine. They played to a varied
        audience and in parts of Ukraine where they were completely unknown to their
        audience.\n\nDuring the protests that followed after the disputed election
        results at the end of 2004, Mandry were one of many bands who appeared on
        stage in [[Maidan Nezalezhnosti]] (Independence Square) in Kyiv to keep the
        [[Orange Revolution]] protesters entertained.\n\nIn 2005 the band recorded
        their latest album ''''Doroha'''', which was released in February 2006. At
        that time they often took part in folk festivals and concerts in Ukraine and
        neighbouring countries.<ref>''''Kulturalna Warszawa'''' (Cultural Warsaw),
        2005, in Polish</ref>\n\nIn March 2006 they filmed a new video to their song
        \"Ne spy moya ridna zemlya\" (Don''t sleep my native land), a clip with imagery
        depicting Ukraine''s history and its heroes, bringing it right up to date
        with the Orange Revolution.\n\n== Current members ==\n*[[Serhiy Fomenko|Serhiy

        ever.\n\nAt the end of 2003 [[Svyatoslav Vakarchuk]] as the frontman of the
        band became an official Ambassador of Ukrainian Culture.\n\nIn 2004 [[Denys
        Dudko]] (one of the best [[jazz]] bass players in Ukraine) and [[Milo\u0161
        Jeli\u0107]] (composer from [[Novi Sad]], [[Serbia]]) joined the band.\n\nDuring
        the \"[[Orange Revolution]]\" Okean Elzy actively supported the democratic
        changes which the population were demanding, with Slava emerging as a figurehead
        of the revolution.\n\n=== 2005\u2013present ===\n[[File:PNG OE 2013 \u0431\u0435\u043b\u044b\u0439.png|thumbnail|Logo
        of the band]]\nIn 2005 [[Petro Cherniavsky]]  joined the band.\n\nOn September
        22, 2005, Okean Elzy released their new album ''''[[Gloria (Okean Elzy album)|GLORIA]]''''.
        After that the band went on tour (30 cities in Ukraine and 10 in Russia) with
        audio crew Sergey Kamenev, Alexandr Kostin, [[Yurii Barybin]] and Vyacheslav
        Lavrinenko.\n\nIn September 2005, Vakarchuk became UN''s [[Goodwill Ambassador|Ambassador
        of Good Will]]. Also, in September Okean Elzy started joint campaign with
        [[International Organization for Migration|IOM]] and [[MTV Europe Foundation]]
        \u2013 fighting human trafficking. Svyatoslav Vakarchuk as UN''s Ambassador
        of Goodwill during 2006 year had different meetings with students at Ukrainian
        and Poland universities. Now Vakarchuk provides a huge social project running
        to propagate reading as a natural process. The general idea of this project
        is to draw the attention of young people to books and help fight illiteracy.\n\nIn
        November 2006, Okean Elzy visited [[Kosovo]], where musicians had a concert
        for [[peace makers]] from Ukraine, [[Poland]], Germany, United States and
        other countries, which include international contingent of peace makers.\n\nDuring
        the Football World Cup 2006 in Germany Okean Elzy actively supported the Ukrainian
        national team and cheered the fans with their songs. The last song of the
        band called ''''Veseli, brate, chasy nastaly...'''' (\"Oh, brother, merry
        times came...\") as always made a huge splash in Ukraine. The song and the
        video were released as a single and all money profited would be donated to
        the child care center treating [[AIDS]]. Charity activities play a major role
        in OE''s life.\n\nIn April 2006 OE went on tour, which includes [[Chicago]],
        [[New York City]] and [[Toronto]], where thousands sang along their songs.\n\nOn
        April 25, 2007, Okean Elzy released a new album ''''Mira'''' (\"Measure\").
        After that the band went on a huge nationwide tour. During the month they
        held tremendous concerts in 27 Ukrainian cities. The outstanding feature about
        ''''Mira'''' was that all the concerts were held at large cities, mostly stadiums
        and sports palaces. The concerts were attended by more than 120,000 fans,
        which has become a record for the group. For the two Kiev concerts the attendance
        was about 24,000 total. In the [[history of Ukraine]] only Okean Elzy \"for
        the second time (after round of ''''GLORIA'''') brought so many people in
        one place in such a short time.\n\nIn 2010 Okean Elzy went on their Dolce
        Vita Tour, in support of their latest album ''''Dolce Vita'''', which included
        over one hundred concerts in Russia, Ukraine, [[Belarus]], Europe and North
        America.\n\nIn December 2013 the band performed during [[Euromaidan]]-protests.<ref

        Prinz''s second album, ''''Nova Revolyutsia'''', 1991]] -->\n\nThis is what
        Ukrainian music critic and journalist Oleksandr Yevtushenko wrote in one of
        his compilations on contemporary Ukrainian music:\n<blockquote>\n\"I first
        heard the group OPALNYI PRYNZ on the broadcasts of the Ukrainian service of
        [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty|Radio Liberty]]. The songs ''''Hey Ukraino!'''',
        ''''Nash Prapor'''' were played every day. That was at the end of the 1980s.
        But to find out anything about the group was only possible after the release
        of their first album ''''Mandry''''. And after that as music of the \"secretive
        inhabitants of Lviv\" Ukrainian Radio started to play them and the became
        radio-hits. [[Rostyslav Shtyn]] and company came out into the information
        field. But they did not try to conquer it, because first and foremost they
        were concerned with the creation of a European level of musical infrastructure
        with their own agency, recording studio. What we are talking about here is
        a well equipped national factory of stars. The idea didn''t leave Rostyslav
        alone. Thank God, that he gathered his organizational skills and musical talent.
        First of all there was his musical education \u2013 Rostyslav''s education
        is as a violinist. There was the persistent work with stars of multifarious
        stages. At the end of the 1980s the main matter became his group OPALNYI PRYNZ.
        It was created by: Yuri Shtyn (his younger brother), who plays keyboards,
        sings, and writes the music and lyrics, Toomas Vanem \u2013 lead guitar and
        still one other keyboardist Roman Brytsky and singer and guitarist [[Rostyslav
        Shtyn]]. The path of OPALNYI PRYNZ cardinally is different from generally
        accepted schemes. Because for they had the idea of technical and financial
        independence and perfect quality of how they sounded. The group signed a contract
        with one German producers centre and received the possibility of publishing
        its materials on both sides of the [[Iron Curtain]]. At the end of 1990 OPALNYI
        PRYNZ realizes its next project \u2013 the album ''''Nova Revolyutsiya''''.
        Indisputably, all the tracks of the album are woven with the tectonic changes
        in the life of Ukrainian society. It''s impregnated with movement towards
        freedom, the feeling of change. Concurrently it is beautifully recorded. And
        the video clip to the song ''''Nash Prapor'''' was shown on Ukrainian television
        all the way through to the year 2000. Some people confirm, that this clip
        was shown on [[MTV]] in honor of [[Declaration of Independence of Ukraine|Ukraine''s
        declaration of independence]] in 1991. ''''Nova Revolyutsiya'''' \u2013 these
        are very strong and unique compositions ''''Khlib po vodi'''' (Bread upon
        the water), ''''Rozmyti dorohy'''' (Washed out roads), ''''Ty na viyni''''
        (You are at war), ''''Simnadtsyate veresnya'''' (1939 The Seventeenth of September),
        ''''Braty po zbroyii'''' (Brothers in Arms). These are songs that one does
        not forget. Regardless of their primarily studio plane of existence, OPALNYI
        PRYNZ had a considerable influence on the formation of Ukrainian rock-music,
        certain models in their sound in particular, we are talking about the synthesis
        of ethnic music with rock. It is possible that they were the first that did
        it delicately and convincingly. It''s incredible, but OPALNYI PRYNZ even today
        sounds fresh and real.\"<ref>\u0404\u0432\u0442\u0443\u0448\u0435\u043d\u043a\u043e,

        Show'''''' (before 2014, ''''''Quest Pistols'''''') are a Ukrainian pop-rock
        band formed in 2007, originally consisting of Anton Savlepov (vocals, guitar),
        Nikita Goruk (vocals, bass), and Konstantin ''Kostya'' Borovsky (vocals, keyboard).
        In 2012 Kostya left the band and was replaced by Daniel Joy. The band began
        as a group of dancers in a show called \"Quest Ballet\". On April 1, 2007
        they took part as singers during the show \"Chance\" as an April Fools joke
        with the song \"\u042f \u0443\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043b\" and received over
        60,000 positive votes. After their success, the group decided to become a
        band.<ref>\"[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/guide/citylife/detail/30194/ Kiev
        Post]\"</ref> Since their formation, the band has released the studio albums:
        Dlja tebja, in 2007 and Superklass in 2009; and one EP \"\u0412\u043e\u043b\u0448\u0435\u0431\u043d\u044b\u0435

        in 2008, and now the single ''Forget Everything'' in 2013 (later added to
        the album ''Shards of Ice''). This song marks the start of ''a new stage''
        of the band,<ref>http://www.intermedia.ru/news/242394?page=1</ref> completely
        different from the usual image. The press team commented; ''With this release,
        they start the next level in their musical career, it''s changed not only
        the style of sound, but the pitch, perception, positioning, and also the choice
        of material.'' Most recently, the band released ''Shards of Ice'', which takes
        the band in a more electronic and synthpop direction.\n\nIn 2008 the band
        won the [[MTV Europe Music Award for Best Ukrainian Act|MTV Europe Music Awards
        2008 as best Ukrainian Act of the year]]. The same year, the band created
        \"\u041c\u0430\u043c\u0430\" for the soundtrack of Vladivostok FM; the fictitious
        radio station in [[Grand Theft Auto IV]].<ref>\"[[Grand Theft Auto IV soundtrack#Vladivostok
        FM|Grand Theft Auto IV soundtrack]]\"</ref>\n\nIn 2009 the band had been touring
        across Russia, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkey, Belarus, Latvia, Estonia and
        Germany. Tour live audio design was created by [[Yurii Barybin]].\n\nIn 2009
        Quest Pistols won ''''''[[MTV Europe Music Awards]]'''''' as the best band.\n\nIn
        January 2016, Anton Savlepov and Nikita Goruk left the band and joined former
        Quest Pistols member Konstantin Borovsky in a new band called ''''''\u0410\u0433\u043e\u043d\u044c''''''.<ref>http://m.vk.com/yo_agon{{dead

        [[band (music)|band]] from [[Ukraine]]. It was formed in 2004 in [[Lviv]],
        [[Ukraine]]. The music style of the band can be described as melodic [[gothic
        metal]], with several songs referring to [[symphonic metal]] and [[doom metal]].\n\n==
        History ==\nHaving created their first material, in the early 2005 the musicians
        recorded a demo, which included four songs. In a couple of months \"Polynove
        Pole\" already started to participate in concerts and rock festivals in Lviv
        and other cities. After the considerable changes in the cast at the beginning
        of 2007 their music changed in a way. It has become tangibly heavier, more
        melodic and closer to the formerly chosen gothic metal style. New members
        joined the band (amond them \u2013 the soloist of  Lviv Philharmonic [[Marianna
        Laba]]). That enabled he band to develop a new quality of composing music
        and onstage performance.\n\nSince autumn of 2008 the musicians have got down
        to work on studio records, where they create their first official release
        \u2013 a short-lasting album \"Pure souls\". The second official release,
        a complete album ''''On Seven Winds'''' was brought out in spring 2009, combining
        the best of the band from all the previous years. Throughout the year 2009
        they carry on with concerts and a new musical material. In September, 2009
        Polynove Pole performed on the biggest in Eastern Europe gothic festival \"Children
        Of  The  Night:  The Black Council\". In October they started working on the
        third short-lasting album, ''''Under The Cold Stone'''', released in December
        2009.\nDuring their stage activity, the band has plated on the same stage
        with such famous Ukrainian and European bands as \"Inferno\", \"Komu Vnyz\"
        ([[Ukraine]]), [[Lake of Tears]] ([[Sweden]]), \"Torhaus\", \"Cemetery of
        Scream\" ([[Poland]]).\n\nBeginning from 2010 the band stopped their activity
        due to members discordance about creative approaches.\n\nOn July 3, 2012 the
        demise of the band was officially declared.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rock.lviv.ua/band/321/

        is a [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] [[pop rock]] band. It was formed in 2001 in [[Ternopil]],
        Ukraine.\n\n==History==\nAfter the band was formed in 2001, it started to
        tour the country and performed at several festivals like Perlyny sezonu, Tavriyski
        ihry and Chervona ruta. They became more known to a broader audience after
        their appearance on the programme ''''Fresh Blood'''' on the Ukrainian TV
        channel M1. The general director Eduard Klim from Lavina Music saw them and
        signed them to his label.\n\nIn 2006 their first album, ''''Te, shcho treba'''',
        was released. They released their second album ''''Planeta S.K.A.Y.''''  in
        2007.\n\nIn 2008,  frontman Oleh Sobchuk was awarded the medal of the [[Ukrainian
        Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate)]] \"1020 Years of Baptism of Rus\" for
        his participation in the rock-tour with the same name.<ref>\"His Beatitude
        Metropolitan Volodymyr Handed Out Church Awards to Priests and Musicians Who
        Took Part in All-Ukraine Rock Tour Dedicated to 1020th Years of the Baptism
        of Rus\", Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate), 2008.</ref>\n\nIn
        October-November 2013 the group took part in agitational concerts \"We are
        united\" along with popular Ukrainian and Russian bands (Chaif, Bratya Karamazovy
        etc.). After concerts part of Ukrainian media wrote that the band supports
        pro-Russian politician [[Viktor Medvedchuk]], which probably could be one
        of unofficial organizers of the tour. However, since other singers disclaimed
        their support to Putin''s politics, Oleh Sobchuk and other members of the
        band cancelled all cooperation with them and with any other events that could
        be related with politics. Later on the official website musicians explained
        their negative position to any politic forces. <ref>http://skay.com.ua/history/</ref>\n\n==Current

        punk|hardcore]] band from [[Pokrov, Ukraine]].\n\n== History ==\nIn fact,
        the history of the band began in the summer of 1994, when Oleksandr Kukhtin,
        Oleksandr Stepanenko, Andriy Diadiura, Vitaliy Kuznetsov and Oleksandr Yefymenko,
        changing the names (\"Nekropedofil\", \"Godless\", \"Virgin Cunt\") began
        to give concerts in small towns of Ukraine. In this period it was created
        a number of songs that have become mega hit in the era immediately \"SkinHate\".\n\nIn
        1998, the band took the name \"Hate\", which was later changed to \"SkinHate\".\n\nThe
        first concert took place in [[Kyiv]] in 1999. By this time the group has managed
        to record their own album called \"Skinhate\", after rewriting Moon Records
        called \"War in heads\". The album is dedicated to the memory of one of Andriy
        ''Yuryk'' Diadiura, one of band founders who was killed in 2000.\n\nIn 2002
        SkinHate recorded the second album \u2013 \"Ticket to paradise.\"\n\nIn 2006
        the band released their 3rd album \"All around\".\n\n==Members==\n;Active

        is a popular [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]]/[[rapcore]]/[[alternative hip hop|alternative]]
        crossover band from [[Ukraine]]. They mix styles of guitar rock, hip-hop and
        dance music to produce an energetic compositions and lyrics. \"Tartak\" means
        ''''woodsaw'''' in [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]]. Sashko thought that tartak
        symbolized something energetic, loud, active, and hence appropriate for a
        band name.\n\n==History==\n[[Oleksandr Polozhynskyi|Sashko Polozhynskyi]]
        founded the group in the Fall of 1996 in [[Lutsk]], [[Ukraine]].\n\nThe group
        has released five albums with a total of 74 songs and 9 videos.<ref>[http://www.umka.com.ua/eng/singer/?id=155
        List of Tartak albums]</ref>  Tartak''s songs \"Ni Ya Ne Tu Kokhav\" and \"Stilnykove
        Kohannia\" stayed on the Top 40 charts for 144 days and 75 days respectively.<ref>[http://top40-charts.com/artist.php?aid=6467
        Top40-Charts]</ref>  Tartak was one of the bands that performed during the
        events of the [[Orange Revolution]] as seen in the adjacent picture.\n\nThe
        true founder of Tartak was [[Vasyl Zinkevytch jr.]], a friend of Sashko. [[Bohdan
        Zinkevych]] came up with the name. Vasyl came up with the idea and put together
        the group; he also arranged the rehearsals since his father is a famous singer
        he has access to studios, so they could make records. At the beginning they
        were struggling because their lyrics weren''t a success and the soloist (Vasyl
        Zinkevych) had no voice for lyrics they wrote. Sashko soon made changes because
        for a long time he was trying to make a place for himself in the show business.
        In the late 90''s Sashko was making his way as a showman on the concerts,
        parades, and other musical events when his fame actually came to him he claimed
        that the idea of Tartak was his idea.\n\n==Discography==\n\n===Studio Albums===\n*

        ===\nFrom the early childhood, Lesya and Halya surrounded by poetry, music,
        painting - both Ukrainian and the best world samples. Their father [[Stanislav
        Telnyuk]] - is Ukrainian writer, literary critic, poet, translator, and their
        mother Nelly Kopylova - is linguist, translator of Oriental Languages, editor.
        The atmosphere of the poetic word, with its rhythms, colors, melodies - has
        become an integral and organic in shaping the ideological position of artist`s
        future.\n\nThe first musical compositions Sisters began creating in the 13-year-old
        age: rock ballads, sketches, pastels, elegies, songs for choral performance
        on the verses of poets-classics of Ukrainian literature.\n\nLesya and Halya
        entrusted first serious attempt to arranging their own songs to talented composer
        - Alexander Melnyk. This was the beginning of creative collaboration (\"I
        stand on the cliff ...\" \"Do not look so friendly ...\" \"By psalteries ...\").\n\n==

        song. Albums: \"Moment\"(\"Myt`\"), \"Lesya and Halya\" and nearly a dozen
        songs off collections continued this creative collaboration. In those 90''s,
        the duo`s songs and arrangements were created by the young, brilliant composer
        Andryj Shust (\"Falcon\"(\"Sokil\"), \"Belles Summer has passed ...\").\n\nInteresting
        songs with a new sound appeared with the advent of the creative pianist and

        of several Telnyuk Sisters songs, which successfully performs on their concerts
        at home and abroad.\n\nNew, original ideas connect Halya and Lesya with Ukrainian

        where members of the band lived. They performed at the camp graduation ceremony,
        after which it was decided to gather the full band on 1 September 1989 at
        the school No. 11 where they studied. In September of the same year during
        [[subbotnik]], the band guitarist Ivan Rykov, instead of painting a goal post,
        drew at the school shooting range a phrase \"''''\u041d\u041e\u0412\u042b\u0415

        he ran out of paint (\u0413\u0420\u0423\u041f\u041f\u0410 in Russian means
        a band). The phrase survived for over 20 years, but faded away over a time.
        Originally Novye Doma played near the local Palace of Pioneers (southeastern
        portion of the city), but later managed to secure a studio at the Palace of
        Pioneers in the west side of the city where they performed in 1990-1994. Coincidentally
        just over the fence from the Palace of Culture was located a boarding music
        school where at the same time the future band member Oleh Mykhailyuta was
        learning to play [[bassoon]] ({{lang-it|fagotto}}). The palace administration
        allowed the band to perform under one condition that they would play one of
        the popular songs once a week. Among the composition that they had to learn
        was [[I''ve Been Thinking About You]] by [[Londonbeat]], [[Don''t Cry]] by
        [[Guns''N''Roses]], as well as Soviet pop songs.\n\nOn suggestion of the band''s
        [[wind instrument]]s performer Maksym Lytvynenko, the band changed its name
        to ''''''Tanets na ploschadi Kongo'''''' after the [[Congo Square]] in [[New
        Orleans]], which is considers to be a place where [[jazz]] was born.\n\nSometime
        in 1997 the band changed its name to the current Ukrainian version which was
        adopted for the 1997 Chervona Ruta festival.\n\nTNMK released its first album,
        ''''Zroby meni hip-hop'''', in 1998. The title track became an underground
        hit in [[Ukraine]], but it was only with the release of ''''''Neformat''''''
        in 2001 that they rose to mainstream popularity. ''''Pozhezhi mista Vavilon'''',
        released in 2004, had a harder sound, while ''''Jazzy'''', released in the
        same year, was a [[live album]] recorded with a Ukrainian jazz band, Skhid-Side,
        and featured TNMK songs re-arranged in a jazz and funk  style. In the same
        year, the group toured [[France]] and recorded French versions of some of
        their songs. Their album ''''Syla'''' was voted the best album of 2005 by
        the most popular Ukrainian music portal [http://music.com.ua music.com.ua].
        Their 2008 album, ''''ReFormatTsia vol.2'''', is a compilation of remixes
        of their songs sung by them and other singers such as [[Oleh Skrypka]], [[Mariya
        Burmaka]] and GreatFruit. The album also includes a remix of the song \"[[Chervona
        Ruta (song)|Chervona Ruta]]\" featuring [[Sofia Rotaru]]. In 2014 they realised
        their last album - ''''Dzerkalo''''.\n\n== Discography ==\n* 1998 ''''[[:uk:\u0417\u0440\u043e\u0431\u0438

        [[Okean Elzy]], featuring [[Svyatoslav Vakarchuk]] has long been among the
        most popular bands of Ukrainian pop-rock, and has had some success abroad.  The
        band [[Mandry]] is known for fusing traditional Ukrainian music with rock,
        [[blues]], [[reggae]] and [[chanson]]s. The pop-singer [[Ruslana]] also uses
        some elements of rock in her work.\n\nThe [[Chervona Ruta (festival)|Chervona

        [[Astrofaes]], [[Drudkh]], and [[Hate Forest]].\n\nMetal Heads Mission is
        the biggest metal festival in Ukraine and ex-USSR countries.\n\nUkrainian
        rock songs are commonly sung in either Ukrainian or Russian. Some performers
        pronounce Russian with a Ukrainian accent, as can be heard in some [[Vopli
        Vidopliassova]] songs. Elements include pronouncing all instances of the [[O
        (Cyrillic)|o]] as /o/ (despite being unstressed) and [[Ye (cyrillic)|ye]]
        as /e/. The [[Ge (Cyrillic)|ge]] is also pronounced as /h/ or /x/.\n\n==History==\n\n===1960s-1970s===\nSuch
        bands as [[Eney]] and [[Hutsuly (band)|Hutsuly]] were created in the 1960s
        during [[Khrushchev Thaw]].\n\n''''''[[Eney]]'''''' ({{lang-uk|''''''\u0415\u043d\u0435\u0439''''''}})
        was the [[Ukrainian SSR|Ukrainian]] [[rock music|rock]] band that performed
        its own [[repertoire]]. It was named after the famous character, [[Aeneas]],
        from one of the [[Ivan Kotlyarevsky#The first modern Ukrainian writer|literal
        work]] of [[Ivan Kotlyarevsky]].\n\nDuring 1960''s students from a special
        music school in Kiev formed this group. The group was named after [[Mykola
        Lysenko]]. They initially played unique interpretations of Ukrainian folk
        songs. Later, after members were exposed to  the late works of [[The Beatles]],
        they started to rearrange works of [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]] and [[Khachaturian]].
        In 1971 the band split as Petrynenko and Blinov left it to form the new group
        ''''Dzvony''''. The band started to experiment in new genres: blues and soul.
        In 1972 the band and their music were banned in the Soviet Union and labeled
        \"bourgeois-national\". As a result, all existing records/recordings were
        destroyed. After that the band went underground until 1974. The members then
        merged with ''''Dzvony'''' into the new vocal-instrumental ensemble ''''Decorative
        Trails''''. After the group was accepted to the ''''Ukr-kontsert'''' it changed
        its name to ''''Hrono''''. In 1977 the ensemble became ''''Eney'''' once again.
        After a period of time, the group broke up and members either joined different
        bands or went solo. [[Taras Petrynenko|Petrynenko]] later created his own
        group [[Hrono]].\n\n===1980s===\nThe rise of rock music in the middle of 1980s
        was inspired by [[Gorbachev]]s [[perestroika]] with its [[doctrinal]]s of
        [[glasnost]] and [[uskoreniye]].\n\nSeveral rock bands were formed in Kiev
        in rock club \"Kuznia\". Among them [[Adem (band)|Adem]] (1985), [[Vopli Vidopliasova]]
        (1986), [[Komu Vnyz]] (1988).\n\nThe most promoinent event was [[Chervona
        Ruta (festival)|Chervona Ruta]] [[music festival]] held for the first time
        in [[Chernivtsi]] in 1989.\n\nSuch bands as [[Braty Hadyukiny|Braty Hadiukiny]],
        [[Dead Rooster|Mertvyi Piven]], [[Opalnyi Prynz]], [[Skryabin (band)|Skriabin]]
        and [[The Telnyuk Sisters|Sestry Telniuk]] were formed in the late 1980s\n\n''''''[[Braty

        one of the most successful Ukrainian bands of [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] times.
        The band music style combines different genres such as rock''n''roll, blues,
        punk, reggae, funk and folk. Ironical song lyrics contain a lot of local vernacularisms,
        slang and [[surzhyk]]. The name translates as \"Hadyukin Brothers\", where
        the fictional surname Hadyukin is derived from the word ''''hadiuka'''', or
        \"[[viper]]\". The abbreviation literally means \"[[snake]]s\" (In Ukrainian
        the two words are [[cognate]]s.)\n\nThe band was active mainly between 1988
        and 1996. In January 2006 they held a big solo concert in [[Kiev]] which was
        a big event in Ukrainian media space and was visited by lot of famous people
        (including that time prime minister [[Yulia Tymoshenko]]). After band''s leader
        Serhiy Kuzminskyi died in 2009 the big tribute concert was held in 2011, joined
        by prominent Ukrainian rock musicians such as Komu Vnyz, Vopli Vidoplyasova,
        Okean Elzy and others. In 2014 rest of band members released new album (the

        as an acoustic band. During the second half of the 1990s, they evolved into
        a grunge/art-rock band, though their music can''t be described by one particular
        style. Dead Rooster has changed personnel several times.\n\nMany songs of
        the band were written in lyrics of Ukrainian poets like [[Yuri Andrukhovych]],

        the group; he also arranged the rehearsals since his father is a famous singer
        he has access to studios, so they could make records. At the beginning they
        were struggling because their lyrics weren''t a success and the soloist (Vasyl
        Zinkevych) had no voice for lyrics they wrote. Sashko soon made changes because
        for a long time he was trying to make a place for himself in the show business.
        In the late 90''s Sashko was making his way as a showman on the concerts,

        which plays traditional [[Ukrainian music]], heavily influenced by western
        [[post-punk]].\n\n==Career==\nThe Ukrainians were formed in 1990 by [[The
        Wedding Present|Wedding Present]] guitarist [[Peter Solowka]], with singer/violinist
        [[Len Liggins]] and [[mandolin]] player Roman Remeynes, after all three had
        played on the Wedding Present''s [[Ukrainian John Peel Sessions]] recordings
        (''''Ukrayinski Vystupy v Johna Peela'''', released 1989).  Following the
        success of that release, the trio began composing and recording in Ukrainian
        as a separate band.\n\nIn 1991, their first [[Extended Play|EP]], Oi Divchino,
        was awarded [[Single (music)|Single]] of the Week by British music weekly,
        [[New Musical Express|NME]].<ref>{{Cite web | title = The Ukrainians history  |
        url=http://www.the-ukrainians.com/history | accessdate = 18 January 2011 }}</ref>   Notably,
        the video for this release was filmed in pre-revolution [[Kiev]] making them
        the first western band to produce a video entirely in [[Eastern Europe]].<ref>{{Cite

        | accessdate = 18 January 2011 }}</ref>\n\nIn the same year, Solowka left
        the Wedding Present, later claiming that he had been kicked out, the success
        of the Ukrainian project making him the scapegoat for the band''s lack of
        mainstream success.<ref>{{Cite web | title = Interview with Peter Solowka

        five studio albums as well as various [[live albums]] and EPs, all without
        chart success in the [[United Kingdom|UK]]. They continue to tour regularly,
        especially in [[Poland]] and [[England]].  They celebrated 20 years of the
        band in 2011 with a tour of British [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] clubs.\n\n==Band

        SSR]] of the [[Soviet Union]] (present-day [[Ukraine]]). The leader of the
        band is singer Oleg Skrypka. Vopli Vidopliasova are the founders of Ukrainian
        rock-n-roll style and neo-ethnic rock. They first sang Ukrainian rock outside
        Ukraine. Their influences include folk, patriotic songs, punk, hard rock,
        heavy metal and, most recently, electronic music.\n\nTheir song ''''Den Narodzhennya''''
        is featured in both ''''[[Brother (Russian)|Brother]]'''' movies by director
        [[Aleksei Balabanov]]. Band member Oleh Skrypka has also produced several
        solo albums.\n\nIn 2009, their record label, [[Kraina Mriy]], released all

        material (1986-1996) is in [[Drop C tuning]].\n\n== History ==\nThe band was
        formed in 1986 by guitarist Yuri Zdorenko and bassist Oleksandr Pipa, who
        had played in the band SOS since 1984. It took its name from Vidopliassov,
        a character from ''''[[The Village of Stepanchikovo]]''''. The band had their
        first performance at the Kiev rock club on 30 October 1987, with vocalist
        and accordionist Oleh Skrypka and drummer Serhiy Sakhno.\n\nIn 1988, the band
        played its first concert in Russia at the Rok-Artel festival. The concert
        was taped and released as ''''[[Pershyy koncert v Moskvi]]''''.\n\nIn 1989,
        the band recorded a session at the Faberge Hall of Culture in Kiev, and released
        it as ''''[[Tantsi]]''''. That same year, they appeared on the French compilation
        ''''[[De Lenine a Lennon]]'''', the soundtrack to a French documentary on
        Soviet rock.\n\nIn 1990, they released the album ''''[[Hey, O.K]]'''' on Kobza
        International and appeared on the Canadian compilation ''''This Ain''t No
        Polka'''' (a recording of the 1989 [[Chervona Ruta (festival)|Chervona Ruta]])
        with the song \"Tantsi\". The following year, they played at the Eurockeennes
        festival in France, and the recording was released as ''''[[Abo abo]]''''
        on BSA Records a year later. In 1991, Skripka and Pipa moved to France and
        would divide their time between it and Ukraine, using Phillip Mozha (guitar)
        and Stefan Muflie (drums) as replacements for Zdorenko and Sakhno when touring
        in France.\n\nIn 1992, Skripka, Zdorenko, Pipa and Sakhno entered Komora Studio
        in Kiev to begin recording what would become their debut album, ''''[[Kraina
        Mriy]]'''', released two years later.\n\nIn 1996, Skrypka and Pipa, who had
        just returned from France (having lived there since 1990), moved back to Ukraine
        and began recording the album ''''[[Muzika]]'''', released in 1997. A single
        was released in 1996 with 4 tracks from the album. Skrypka sang, programmed
        the drums and played accordion, traditional Ukrainian folk instruments and
        some guitar, while Pipa played bass. Zdorenko played guitar on the track \"Gei,
        liubo!\". On the album, \"Hei! Liubo!\" is crossfaded with \"Bogi\", but on
        the single, it wasn''t crossfaded and its natural ending rang out, however
        on recent compilations, it just cuts off at the part of the end where \"Bogi\"
        is expected to begin.\n\nIn 1997, Sakhno rejoined the band and Evhen Rohachevsky
        joined as guitarist. With this new lineup, they began recording their third
        album, ''''[[Khvyli Amura]]'''', released in 2000. Around that time, Skrypka
        became interested in Indian music, and the album reflects that, particularly
        in the song \"[[Den narodjennya]]\".\n\nIn 2000, the band contributed tracks
        to tribute albums to [[Grazhdanskaya Oborona]] (\"Pops\") and [[Kino (band)|Kino]]
        (\"Pachka sigaret\" and \"Solnechnye dni\"), and appeared on the Sprite Driver
        2 compilation in 2001 with the song \"Osen\". The latter three songs were
        translated into Ukrainian and appeared as B-sides to the single \"[[Mamay
        (song)|Mamay]]\" that year. In 2002, the album ''''[[Fayno]]'''' was finally
        released, featuring \"Solnechnye dni\" (by then renamed \"Sonyachni dni\"),
        \"Osen\" (by then renamed \"Zoryana osin\"), a remixed version of \"Mamay\",
        a partially re-recorded version of \"Pachka sigaret\" (by then renamed \"Pachka
        tsyharok\") and a censored version of \"Pops\". The original presses on Lavina
        Music and Misteria Zvuka contained three bonus tracks: the original Russian
        version of \"Osen\", \"The Pack of Cigarettes\" (an English version of \"Pachka
        sigaret\") and \"Les jours de soleil\" (a French version of \"Solnechnie dni\"),
        demonstrating Oleh Skrypka''s multilingualism.\n\nIn 2006, Oleksandr Pipa
        left the band and was replaced by Oleksiy Melchenko. They then recorded the
        album ''''[[Buly denky]]'''', a compilation of old songs from the late 80s
        and early 90s which had never got the studio treatment before, but which had
        been played live. That year, they played the first \"Rok-Sich\" festival,
        a festival started by Skrypka with the intent to foster local talent. The
        rules for the Rock Sich are that any genre other than pop is acceptable and
        that all bands must sing in Ukrainian, however VV broke their own rule and
        played \"Pops\" at the concert in the original Russian and with the original
        uncensored lyrics. The performance was released on CD in 2008, DVD in 2011
        and double LP in 2012. The standard one-CD version of the Rock Sich album
        had two tracks cut due to space constraints, but a two-CD version was available
        with the missing tracks restored. The missing tracks were also on the vinyl
        and DVD.\n\nThey released the singles \"Lado\" and \"Chio San\" in 2009 and
        \"Vidpustka\" (a reworking of a track from 1987) in 2010.\n\nTheir next album,
        \"[[Chudovy svit]]\", was released on 18 October 2013. \"Lado\", \"Chio San\"
        and \"Vidpustka\" were included on the album.\n\nThe group have been carrying
        out a vinyl rerelease campaign, with ''''[[Kraina Mriy]]'''', ''''Muzika''''
        and ''''Xvyli Amura'''' being the first to be released in 2013. ''''[[Fayno]]''''
        and ''''[[Chudovy svit]]'''' followed in 2016. ''''Buly denky'''' had already
        been released on vinyl in 2008.\n\n==Members==\n\n===Current members===\n*
