        the beginning of his career, Einstein thought that [[Newtonian mechanics]]
        was no longer enough to reconcile the laws of [[classical mechanics]] with
        the laws of the [[electromagnetic field]]. This led him to develop his [[special
        theory of relativity]] during his time at the [[Swiss Patent Office]] in [[Bern]]
        (1902\u20131909), Switzerland. However, he realized that the principle of
        relativity could also be extended to [[gravitational fields]] and\u2014with
        his subsequent theory of gravitation in 1916\u2014he published a paper on
        [[general relativity]]. He continued to deal with problems of [[statistical
        mechanics]] and quantum theory, which led to his explanations of [[particle]]
        theory and the [[Brownian motion|motion of molecules]]. He also investigated
        the thermal properties of light which laid the foundation of the [[photon]]
        theory of light. In 1917, Einstein applied the general theory of relativity
        to model the large-scale structure of the [[universe]].<ref name=Nobel>{{Citation

        Einstein was born in [[Ulm]], in the [[Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg]] in the
        [[German Empire]], on 14&nbsp;March 1879.<ref name=Bio/> His parents were
        [[Hermann Einstein]], a salesman and engineer, and [[Pauline Koch]]. In 1880,
        the family moved to [[Munich]], where Einstein''s father and his uncle Jakob
        founded ''''Elektrotechnische Fabrik J. Einstein & Cie'''', a company that
        manufactured electrical equipment based on [[direct current]].<ref name=Bio
        />\n\nThe Einsteins were non-observant [[Ashkenazi Jews]], and Albert attended
        a [[Catholic school|Catholic elementary school]] in Munich from the age of
        5 for three years. At the age of 8, he was transferred to the [[Luitpold Gymnasium]]
        (now known as the Albert Einstein Gymnasium), where he received advanced primary
        and secondary school education until he left the [[German Empire]] seven years
        later.{{Sfnp|Stachel|2002|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=OAsQ_hFjhrAC&pg=PA59
        59\u201361]}}\n\nIn 1894, Hermann and Jakob''s company lost a bid to supply
        the city of Munich with electrical lighting because they lacked the capital
        to convert their equipment from the direct current (DC) standard to the more
        efficient [[alternating current]] (AC) standard.<ref>Barry R. Parker, Einstein:
        The Passions of a Scientist, Prometheus Books \u2013 2003, page 31</ref> The
        loss forced the sale of the Munich factory. In search of business, the Einstein
        family moved to Italy, first to [[Milan]] and a few months later to [[Pavia]].
        When the family moved to Pavia, Einstein stayed in Munich to finish his studies
        at the Luitpold Gymnasium. His father intended for him to pursue [[electrical
        engineering]], but Einstein clashed with authorities and resented the school''s
        regimen and teaching method. He later wrote that the spirit of learning and
        creative thought was lost in strict [[rote learning]]. At the end of December
        1894, he travelled to Italy to join his family in Pavia, convincing the school
        to let him go by using a doctor''s note.{{Sfnp|F\u00f6lsing|1997|pp=30\u201331}}
        During his time in Italy he wrote a short essay with the title \"On the Investigation

        16, Einstein took the entrance examinations for the [[ETH Zurich|Swiss Federal
        Polytechnic]] in [[Z\u00fcrich]] (later the Eidgen\u00f6ssische Technische
        Hochschule, ETH). He failed to reach the required standard in the general
        part of the examination,{{Sfnp|Stachel|2008|loc=vol. 1 (1987), p. 11}} but
        obtained exceptional grades in physics and mathematics.{{Sfnp|F\u00f6lsing|1997|pp=36\u201337}}
        On the advice of the principal of the Polytechnic, he attended the [[Aargau|Argovian]]
        [[Mittelschule|cantonal school]] ([[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]]) in [[Aarau]],
        Switzerland, in 1895\u201396 to complete his secondary schooling. While lodging
        with the family of professor Jost Winteler, he fell in love with Winteler''s
        daughter, Marie. (Albert''s sister [[Maja Einstein|Maja]] later married Winteler''s
        son Paul.){{Sfnp|Highfield|Carter|1993|pp=21, 31, 56\u201357}} In January
        1896, with his father''s approval, Einstein renounced his [[German citizenship|citizenship
        in the German Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg]] to avoid [[Conscription in Germany|military
        service]].{{Sfnp|F\u00f6lsing|1997|p=40}} In September 1896, he passed the
        Swiss [[Matura]] with mostly good grades, including a top grade of 6 in physics
        and mathematical subjects, on a scale of 1\u20136.{{Sfnp|Stachel|2008|loc=vol.
        1 (1987), docs. 21\u201327}} Though only 17, he enrolled in the four-year
        mathematics and physics teaching diploma program at the Z\u00fcrich Polytechnic.
        Marie Winteler moved to [[Olsberg, Aargau|Olsberg]], Switzerland, for a teaching
        post.\n\nEinstein''s future wife, [[Mileva Mari\u0107]], also enrolled at
        the Polytechnic that year. She was the only woman among the six students in
        the mathematics and physics section of the teaching diploma course. Over the
        next few years, Einstein and Mari\u0107''s friendship developed into romance,
        and they read books together on extra-curricular physics in which Einstein
        was taking an increasing interest. In 1900, Einstein was awarded the Z\u00fcrich
        Polytechnic teaching diploma, but Mari\u0107 failed the examination with a
        poor grade in the mathematics component, theory of functions.{{Sfnp|Stachel|2008|loc=vol.

        naval officer Commander [[Oliver Locker-Lampson]], who had become friends

        work on relativity remained controversial for many years, but was accepted
        by leading physicists, starting with [[Max Planck]].<ref>For a discussion

        and energy quanta ===\n[[File:Photoelectric effect.svg|thumb|upright|The photoelectric
        effect. Incoming photons on the left strike a metal plate (bottom), and eject
        electrons, depicted as flying off to the right.]]\n{{Main article|Photon|Quantum}}\nIn
        a 1905 paper,{{Sfnp|Einstein|1905a}} Einstein postulated that light itself
        consists of localized particles (''''[[quantum|quanta]]''''). Einstein''s
        light quanta were nearly universally rejected by all physicists, including
        Max Planck and Niels Bohr. This idea only became universally accepted in 1919,
        with [[Robert Millikan]]''s detailed experiments on the photoelectric effect,
        and with the measurement of [[Compton scattering]].\n\nEinstein concluded
        that each wave of frequency ''''f'''' is associated with a collection of [[photon]]s
        with energy ''''hf'''' each, where ''''h'''' is [[Planck''s constant]]. He
        does not say much more, because he is not sure how the particles are related
        to the wave. But he does suggest that this idea would explain certain experimental
        results, notably the photoelectric effect.{{sfnp|Einstein|1905a}}\n\n=== Quantized
        atomic vibrations ===\n{{Main article|Einstein solid}}\nIn 1907, Einstein
        proposed a model of matter where each atom in a lattice structure is an independent
        harmonic oscillator. In the Einstein model, each atom oscillates independently\u2014a
        series of equally spaced quantized states for each oscillator. Einstein was
        aware that getting the frequency of the actual oscillations would be difficult,
        but he nevertheless proposed this theory because it was a particularly clear
        demonstration that quantum mechanics could solve the specific heat problem
        in classical mechanics. [[Peter Debye]] refined this model.<ref>[http://www.osti.gov/accomplishments/nuggets/einstein/solidcolda.html

        Technical Information]], 2011.</ref>\n\n=== Adiabatic principle and action-angle
        variables ===\n{{Main article|Old quantum theory}}\nThroughout the 1910s,
        quantum mechanics expanded in scope to cover many different systems. After
        [[Ernest Rutherford]] discovered the nucleus and proposed that electrons orbit
        like planets, Niels Bohr was able to show that the same quantum mechanical
        postulates introduced by Planck and developed by Einstein would explain the
        discrete motion of electrons in atoms, and the [[periodic table of the elements]].\n\nEinstein
        contributed to these developments by linking them with the 1898 arguments
        [[Wilhelm Wien]] had made. Wien had shown that the hypothesis of [[adiabatic
        invariant|adiabatic invariance]] of a thermal equilibrium state allows all
        the [[blackbody radiation|blackbody curves]] at different temperature to be
        derived from one another by a [[Wien''s displacement law|simple shifting process]].
        Einstein noted in 1911 that the same adiabatic principle shows that the quantity
        which is quantized in any mechanical motion must be an adiabatic invariant.
        [[Arnold Sommerfeld]] identified this adiabatic invariant as the [[action-angle
        variables|action variable]] of classical mechanics.\n\n=== Wave\u2013particle

        duality}}\nAlthough the patent office promoted Einstein to Technical Examiner
        Second Class in 1906, he had not given up on academia. In 1908, he became
        a ''''[[Privatdozent]]'''' at the University of Bern.{{Sfnp|Pais|1982|p=522}}
        In \"''''\u00dcber die Entwicklung unserer Anschauungen \u00fcber das Wesen

        the Composition and Essence of Radiation]]\"), on the [[quantization (physics)|quantization]]
        of light, and in an earlier 1909 paper, Einstein showed that Max Planck''s
        energy quanta must have well-defined [[momentum|momenta]] and act in some
        respects as independent, [[point particle|point-like particles]]. This paper
        introduced the ''''photon'''' concept (although the name ''''photon'''' was
        introduced later by [[Gilbert N. Lewis]] in 1926) and inspired the notion
        of [[wave\u2013particle duality]] in [[quantum mechanics]]. Einstein saw this
        wave\u2013particle duality in radiation as concrete evidence for his conviction
        that physics needed a new, unified foundation.\n\n=== Theory of critical opalescence
        ===\n{{Main article|Critical opalescence}}\nEinstein returned to the problem
        of thermodynamic fluctuations, giving a treatment of the density variations
        in a fluid at its critical point. Ordinarily the density fluctuations are
        controlled by the second derivative of the free energy with respect to the
        density. At the critical point, this derivative is zero, leading to large
        fluctuations. The effect of density fluctuations is that light of all wavelengths
        is scattered, making the fluid look milky white. Einstein relates this to
        [[Rayleigh scattering]], which is what happens when the fluctuation size is
        much smaller than the wavelength, and which explains why the sky is blue.<ref>{{cite

        derived critical opalescence from a treatment of density fluctuations, and

        atomistic constitution of matter.\n\n=== Zero-point energy ===\n{{Main article|Zero-point
        energy}}\nIn a series of works completed from 1911 to 1913, Planck reformulated
        his 1900 quantum theory and introduced the idea of zero-point energy in his
        \"second quantum theory\". Soon, this idea attracted the attention of Einstein
        and his assistant [[Otto Stern]]. Assuming the energy of rotating diatomic
        molecules contains zero-point energy, they then compared the theoretical specific
        heat of hydrogen gas with the experimental data. The numbers matched nicely.
        However, after publishing the findings, they promptly withdrew their support,
        because they no longer had confidence in the correctness of the idea of zero-point
        energy.{{Sfnp|Stachel|2008|loc=vol. 4: The Swiss Years: Writings, 1912\u20131914|pp=270ff}}\n\n===

        the sun, rays visible around it, in a dark sky.|thumb|upright|[[Arthur Stanley
        Eddington|Eddington]]''s photograph of a [[solar eclipse]]]]\nGeneral relativity
        (GR) is a [[theory of gravitation]] that was developed by Einstein between
        1907 and 1915. According to [[general relativity]], the observed gravitational
        attraction between masses results from the warping of [[spacetime|space and
        time]] by those masses. General relativity has developed into an essential
        tool in modern [[astrophysics]]. It provides the foundation for the current
        understanding of [[black holes]], regions of space where gravitational attraction
        is so strong that not even light can escape.\n\nAs Einstein later said, the
        reason for the development of general relativity was that the preference of
        inertial motions within [[special relativity]] was unsatisfactory, while a
        theory which from the outset prefers no state of motion (even accelerated
        ones) should appear more satisfactory.{{Sfnp|Einstein|1923}} Consequently,
        in 1907 he published an article on acceleration under special relativity.
        In that article titled \"On the Relativity Principle and the Conclusions Drawn
        from It\", he argued that [[free fall]] is really inertial motion, and that
        for a free-falling observer the rules of special relativity must apply. This
        argument is called the [[equivalence principle]]. In the same article, Einstein
        also predicted the phenomena of [[gravitational time dilation]], [[gravitational
        red shift]] and [[Gravitational lensing|deflection of light]].{{Sfnp|Pais|1982|pp=179\u2013183}}{{Sfnp|Stachel|2008|loc=vol.

        Einstein published another article \"On the Influence of Gravitation on the
        Propagation of Light\" expanding on the 1907 article, in which he estimated
        the amount of deflection of light by massive bodies. Thus, the theoretical
        prediction of general relativity can for the first time be tested experimentally.{{Sfnp|Pais|1982|pp=194\u2013195}}\n\n====Gravitational

        of spacetime which propagate as [[wave]]s, traveling outward from the source,
        transporting energy as gravitational radiation. The existence of gravitational
        waves is possible under general relativity due to its [[Lorentz invariance]]
        which brings the concept of a finite speed of propagation of the physical
        interactions of gravity with it. By contrast, gravitational waves cannot exist
        in the [[Newton''s law of universal gravitation|Newtonian theory of gravitation]],
        which postulates that the physical interactions of gravity propagate at infinite
        speed.\n\nThe first, indirect, detection of gravitational waves came in the

        article|Hole argument}}\nWhile developing general relativity, Einstein became
        confused about the [[gauge invariance]] in the theory. He formulated an argument
        that led him to conclude that a general relativistic field theory is impossible.
        He gave up looking for fully generally covariant tensor equations, and searched
        for equations that would be invariant under general linear transformations
        only.\n\nIn June 1913, the Entwurf (\"draft\") theory was the result of these
        investigations. As its name suggests, it was a sketch of a theory, less elegant
        and more difficult than general relativity, with the equations of motion supplemented
        by additional gauge fixing conditions. After more than two years of intensive
        work, Einstein realized that the [[hole argument]] was mistaken<ref>van Dongen,
        Jeroen (2010) ''''Einstein''s Unification'''' Cambridge University Press,
        p.23.</ref> and abandoned the theory in November 1915.\n\n=== Physical Cosmology
        ===\n{{Main article|Physical Cosmology}}\n{{cosmology|scientists}}\nIn 1917,
        Einstein applied the general theory of relativity to the structure of the
        universe as a whole.{{Sfnp|Einstein|1917a}} He discovered that the general
        field equations predicted a universe that was dynamic, either contracting
        or expanding. As observational evidence for a dynamic universe was not known
        at the time, Einstein introduced a new term, the [[cosmological constant]],
        to the field equations, in order to allow the theory to predict a static universe.
        The modified field equations predicted a static universe of closed curvature,
        in accordance with Einstein''s understanding of [[Mach''s principle]] in these
        years. This model became known as the Einstein World or [[Einstein''s static
        universe]].{{Sfnp|Pais|1994|pp=285\u2013286}} <ref>{{cite book|last1=North|first1=J.D.|title=The

        Einstein published an article in ''''Physikalische Zeitschrift'''' that proposed
        the possibility of [[stimulated emission]], the physical process that makes
        possible the [[maser]] and the [[laser]].{{Sfnp|Einstein|1917b}}\nThis article
        showed that the statistics of absorption and emission of light would only
        be consistent with Planck''s distribution law if the emission of light into
        a mode with n photons would be enhanced statistically compared to the emission
        of light into an empty mode. This paper was enormously influential in the
        later development of quantum mechanics, because it was the first paper to
        show that the statistics of atomic transitions had simple laws. Einstein discovered
        [[Louis de Broglie]]''s work, and supported his ideas, which were received
        skeptically at first. In another major paper from this era, Einstein gave
        a wave equation for [[Matter wave|de Broglie waves]], which Einstein suggested
        was the [[Hamilton\u2013Jacobi equation]] of mechanics. This paper would inspire
        Schr\u00f6dinger''s work of 1926.\n\n=== Bose\u2013Einstein statistics ===\n{{Main
        article|Bose\u2013Einstein statistics}}\nIn 1924, Einstein received a description
        of a [[statistical mechanics|statistical]] model from Indian physicist [[Satyendra
        Nath Bose]], based on a counting method that assumed that light could be understood
        as a gas of indistinguishable particles. Einstein noted that Bose''s statistics
        applied to some atoms as well as to the proposed light particles, and submitted
        his translation of Bose''s paper to the ''''[[Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Physik]]''''.
        Einstein also published his own articles describing the model and its implications,
        among them the [[Bose\u2013Einstein condensate]] phenomenon that some particulates
        should appear at very low temperatures.{{Sfnp|Einstein|1924}} It was not until
        1995 that the first such condensate was produced experimentally by [[Eric
        Allin Cornell]] and [[Carl Wieman]] using [[ultracold atom|ultra-cooling]]
        equipment built at the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology|NIST]]\u2013[[JILA]]

        of the Leiden University.<ref name=Instituut-Lorentz />\n\n=== Energy momentum
        pseudotensor ===\n{{Main article|Stress\u2013energy\u2013momentum pseudotensor}}\nGeneral
        relativity includes a dynamical spacetime, so it is difficult to see how to
        identify the conserved energy and momentum. [[Noether''s theorem]] allows
        these quantities to be determined from a [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian]]
        with [[Translational symmetry|translation invariance]], but [[general covariance]]
        makes translation invariance into something of a [[gauge symmetry]]. The energy
        and momentum derived within general relativity by Noether''s presecriptions
        do not make a real tensor for this reason.\n\nEinstein argued that this is
        true for fundamental reasons, because the gravitational field could be made
        to vanish by a choice of coordinates. He maintained that the non-covariant
        energy momentum pseudotensor was in fact the best description of the energy
        momentum distribution in a gravitational field. This approach has been echoed
        by [[Lev Landau]] and [[Evgeny Lifshitz]], and others, and has become standard.\n\nThe
        use of non-covariant objects like pseudotensors was heavily criticized in
        1917 by [[Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger]] and others.\n\n=== Unified field theory
        ===\n{{Main article|Classical unified field theories}}\nFollowing his research
        on general relativity, Einstein entered into a series of attempts to generalize
        his geometric theory of gravitation to include electromagnetism as another
        aspect of a single entity. In 1950, he described his \"[[unified field theory]]\"
        in a ''''[[Scientific American]]'''' article titled \"On the Generalized Theory
        of Gravitation\".{{Sfnp|Einstein|1950}} Although he continued to be lauded
        for his work, Einstein became increasingly isolated in his research, and his
        efforts were ultimately unsuccessful.\nIn his pursuit of a unification of
        the fundamental forces, Einstein ignored some mainstream developments in physics,
        most notably the [[strong nuclear force|strong]] and [[weak nuclear force]]s,
        which were not well understood until many years after his death. Mainstream
        physics, in turn, largely ignored Einstein''s approaches to unification. Einstein''s
        dream of unifying other laws of physics with gravity motivates modern quests
        for a [[theory of everything]] and in particular [[string theory]], where
        geometrical fields emerge in a unified quantum-mechanical setting.\n\n===
        Wormholes ===\n{{Main article|Wormhole}}\nIn 1935, Einstein collaborated with
        [[Nathan Rosen]] to produce a model of a [[wormhole]], often called [[Einstein\u2013Rosen
        bridges]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Einstein, Albert |author2=Rosen, Nathan

        April 2017}}</ref> His motivation was to model elementary particles with charge
        as a solution of gravitational field equations, in line with the program outlined
        in the paper \"Do Gravitational Fields play an Important Role in the Constitution
        of the Elementary Particles?\". These solutions cut and pasted [[Schwarzschild
        black hole]]s to make a bridge between two patches.<ref>{{cite web|title=Focus:

        one end of a wormhole was positively charged, the other end would be negatively
        charged. These properties led Einstein to believe that pairs of particles
        and antiparticles could be described in this way.\n\n=== Einstein\u2013Cartan

        of Berlin]], 1920]]In order to incorporate spinning point particles into general
        relativity, the affine connection needed to be generalized to include an antisymmetric
        part, called the [[Torsion tensor|torsion]]. This modification was made by
        Einstein and Cartan in the 1920s.\n\n=== Equations of motion ===\n{{Main article|Einstein\u2013Infeld\u2013Hoffmann
        equations}}\nThe theory of general relativity has a fundamental law\u2014the
        [[Einstein equations]] which describe how space curves, the [[geodesic equation]]
        which describes how particles move may be derived from the Einstein equations.\n\nSince
        the equations of general relativity are non-linear, a lump of energy made
        out of pure gravitational fields, like a black hole, would move on a trajectory
        which is determined by the Einstein equations themselves, not by a new law.
        So Einstein proposed that the path of a singular solution, like a black hole,
        would be determined to be a geodesic from general relativity itself.\n\nThis
        was established by Einstein, Infeld, and Hoffmann for pointlike objects without
        angular momentum, and by [[Roy Kerr]] for spinning objects.\n\n=== Other investigations
        ===\n{{Main article|Einstein''s unsuccessful investigations}}\nEinstein conducted
        other investigations that were unsuccessful and abandoned. These pertain to
        [[force]], [[superconductivity]], and other research.\n\n=== Collaboration
        with other scientists ===\n[[File:Solvay conference 1927.jpg|thumb|The 1927
        [[Solvay Conference]] in Brussels, a gathering of the world''s top physicists.
        Einstein is in the center.]]\nIn addition to longtime collaborators [[Leopold
        Infeld]], [[Nathan Rosen]], [[Peter Bergmann]] and others, Einstein also had
        some one-shot collaborations with various scientists.\n\n==== Einstein\u2013de
        Haas experiment ====\n{{Main article|Einstein\u2013de Haas effect}}\nEinstein
        and De Haas demonstrated that magnetization is due to the motion of electrons,
        nowadays known to be the spin. In order to show this, they reversed the magnetization
        in an iron bar suspended on a [[torsion pendulum]]. They confirmed that this
        leads the bar to rotate, because the electron''s angular momentum changes
        as the magnetization changes. This experiment needed to be sensitive, because
        the angular momentum associated with electrons is small, but it definitively
        established that electron motion of some kind is responsible for magnetization.\n\n====
        Schr\u00f6dinger gas model ====\nEinstein suggested to Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger
        that he might be able to reproduce the statistics of a [[Bose\u2013Einstein
        condensate|Bose\u2013Einstein gas]] by considering a box. Then to each possible
        quantum motion of a particle in a box associate an independent harmonic oscillator.
        Quantizing these oscillators, each level will have an integer occupation number,
        which will be the number of particles in it.\n\nThis formulation is a form
        of [[second quantization]], but it predates modern quantum mechanics. Erwin
        Schr\u00f6dinger applied this to derive the [[thermodynamic]] properties of
        a [[Quantum chaos|semiclassical]] [[ideal gas]]. Schr\u00f6dinger urged Einstein
        to add his name as co-author, although Einstein declined the invitation.<ref>{{Citation

        Einstein\u2013Podolsky\u2013Rosen paradox ===\n{{Main article|EPR paradox}}\nIn
        1935, Einstein returned to the question of quantum mechanics. He considered
        how a measurement on one of two entangled particles would affect the other.
        He noted, along with his collaborators, that by performing different measurements
        on the distant particle, either of position or momentum, different properties
        of the entangled partner could be discovered without disturbing it in any
        way.\n\nHe then used a hypothesis of [[local realism]] to conclude that the
        other particle had these properties already determined. The principle he proposed
        is that if it is possible to determine what the answer to a position or momentum
        measurement would be, without in any way disturbing the particle, then the
        particle actually has values of position or momentum.\n\nThis principle distilled
        the essence of Einstein''s objection to quantum mechanics. As a physical principle,
        it was shown to be incorrect when the [[Aspect experiment]] of 1982 confirmed
        [[Bell''s theorem]], which had been promulgated in 1964.\n\n== Non-scientific
        legacy ==\nWhile traveling, Einstein wrote daily to his wife Elsa and adopted
        stepdaughters Margot and Ilse. The letters were included in the papers bequeathed
        to [[The Hebrew University]]. Margot Einstein permitted the personal letters
