        comes from the [[Spanish language]], however the naming itself is not Spanish,
        but [[Italian language|Italian]]. ''''Argentina'''' ([[Grammatical gender|masculine]]
        ''''argentino'''') means in Italian \"(made) of silver, silver coloured\",
        probably borrowed from the  [[French language|Old French]] adjective ''''argentine''''
        \"(made) of silver\" > \"silver coloured\" already mentioned in the 12th century.<ref>[http://www.cnrtl.fr/etymologie/argentin
        Etymology of ''''argentin / -e'''' (French)]</ref> The French word ''''argentine''''
        is the [[Grammatical gender|feminine]] form of ''''argentin'''' and derives
        from ''''argent'''' \"silver\" with the [[suffix]] ''''-in'''' (same construction
        as Old French ''''acerin'''' \"(made) of steel\", from ''''acier'''' \"steel\"
        + ''''-in'''' or ''''sapin'''' \"(made) of fir wood\", from OF ''''sap''''
        \"fir\" + ''''-in''''). The Italian naming \"Argentina\" for the country implies
        ''''Argentina Terra'''' \"land of silver\" or ''''Argentina costa'''' \"coast
        of silver\". In Italian, the adjective or the [[proper noun]] is often used
        in an autonomous way as a substantive and replaces it and it is said ''''l''Argentina''''
        (It cannot be for the proper noun in French for example).\n\nThe name ''''Argentina''''
        was probably first given by the Venetian and Genoese navigators, such as [[Giovanni
        Caboto]]. In Spanish and Portuguese, the words for \"silver\" are respectively
        ''''plata'''' and ''''prata'''' and \"(made) of silver\" is said ''''plateado''''
        and ''''prateado''''. ''''Argentina'''' was first associated with the [[Sierra
        de la Plata|silver mountains legend]], widespread among the first European

        is still debated, however, as in some senses the long political war started
        in 1969. Trade unionists were targeted for assassination by the Peronist and
        Marxist paramilitaries as early as 1969, and individual cases of [[state-sponsored
        terrorism]] against Peronism and the left can be traced back to the [[Bombing
        of Plaza de Mayo]] in 1955. The [[Trelew massacre]] of 1972, the actions of
        the [[Argentine Anticommunist Alliance]] since 1973, and [[Isabel Mart\u00ednez
        de Per\u00f3n]]''s \"annihilation decrees\" against left-wing guerrillas during
        ''''[[Operativo Independencia]]'''' (translates to Operation of Independence)
        in 1975, have also been suggested as dates for the beginning of the Dirty
        War.\n\nOngan\u00eda shut down Congress, banned all political parties and
        dismantled student and worker unions. In 1969, popular discontent led to two
        massive protests: the ''''[[Cordobazo]]'''' and the ''''[[Rosariazo]]''''.
        The terrorist guerrilla organization [[Montoneros]] kidnapped and executed
        Aramburu.{{sfn|Robben|2011|p=127}} The newly chosen head of government, [[Alejandro
        Agust\u00edn Lanusse]], seeking to ease the growing political pressure, let
        [[H\u00e9ctor Jos\u00e9 C\u00e1mpora]] be the Peronist candidate instead of
        Per\u00f3n. C\u00e1mpora won the [[Argentine general election, March 1973|March

        between Peronist internal factions\u2014[[right-wing]] union leaders and [[left-wing]]
        youth from Montoneros\u2014resulted in the [[Ezeiza Massacre]]. C\u00e1mpora
        resigned, overwhelmed by political violence, and Per\u00f3n won the [[Argentine

        judges of the Supreme Court, banned political parties and unions, and resorted
        to the [[forced disappearance]] of suspected guerrilla members and of anyone
        believed to be associated with the left-wing. By the end of 1976 Montoneros
        had lost near 2,000 members; by 1977, the ERP was completely defeated. A severely
        weakened Montoneros launched a counterattack in 1979, which was quickly annihilated,
        ending the guerrilla threat. Nevertheless, the junta stayed in power. Then
        head of state General [[Leopoldo Galtieri]] launched [[Operation Rosario]],
        which escalated into the [[Falklands War]] ({{lang-es|link=no|Guerra de Malvinas}});

        to the treatment of [[heart disease]]s and several forms of cancer. [[Domingo
        Liotta]] designed and developed the first [[artificial heart]] successfully
        implanted in a human being in 1969. [[Ren\u00e9 Favaloro]] developed the techniques

        1957 Argentina was the first country in Latin America to design and build
        a [[research reactor]] with homegrown technology, the [[RA-1 Enrico Fermi]].
        This reliance in the development of own nuclear related technologies, instead
        of simply buying them abroad, was a constant of Argentina''s nuclear programme
        conducted by the civilian [[National Atomic Energy Commission]] (CNEA). Nuclear
        facilities with Argentine technology have been built in Peru, Algeria, Australia
        and Egypt. In 1983, the country admitted having the capability of producing
        weapon-grade [[uranium]], a major step needed to assemble [[nuclear weapon]]s;
        since then, however, Argentina has pledged to use nuclear power only for peaceful

        tariffs for water supply and sanitation in Argentina are relatively low, the
        service quality reasonable. However, according to the [[WHO]], 21% of the
        total population remains without access to house connections and 52% of the
        urban population do not have access to [[sewerage]].\n\nBetween 1991 and 1999,
        as part of one of the world''s largest privatization programs, water and sanitation\nconcessions
        with the private sector were signed. After the 2001 economic crisis, many
        concessions were renegotiated.\n\nMost service providers barely recover operation
        and maintenance costs and have no capacity to self-finance investments. While
        private \noperators were able to achieve higher levels of cost recovery, since
        the [[1998\u20132002 Argentine great depression|Argentine financial crisis]]
        in 2002 tariffs have been frozen and the self-financing capacity of utilities
        has disappeared.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Main article|Demographics of Argentina}}\n{{See

        most prominent Argentine playwrights.\n\nArgentine theatre traces its origins
        to Viceroy [[Juan Jos\u00e9 de V\u00e9rtiz y Salcedo]]''s creation of the
        colony''s first theatre, ''''La Rancher\u00eda'''', in 1783. In this stage,
        in 1786, a tragedy entitled ''''Siripo'''' had its premiere. ''''Siripo''''
        is now a lost work (only the second act is conserved), and can be considered
        the first Argentine stage play, because it was written by Buenos Aires poet
        Manuel Jos\u00e9 de Lavard\u00e9n, it was premiered in Buenos Aires, and its
        plot was inspired by an historical episode of the early colonization of the
        [[R\u00edo de la Plata Basin]]: the destruction of [[Sancti Spiritu (Argentina)|Sancti
        Spiritu]] colony by aboriginals in 1529. ''''La Rancher\u00eda'''' theatre
        operated until its destruction in a fire in 1792. The second theatre stage
        in Buenos Aires was [[Teatro Coliseo]], opened in 1804 during the term of
        Viceroy [[Rafael de Sobremonte]]. It was the nation''s longest-continuously
        operating stage. The musical creator of the Argentine National Anthem, [[Blas
        Parera]], earned fame as a theatre score writer during the early 19th century.
        The genre suffered during the regime of [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]], though it
        flourished alongside the economy later in the century. The national government
        gave Argentine theatre its initial impulse with the establishment of the [[Col\u00f3n
        Theatre]], in 1857, which hosted classical and operatic, as well as stage
        performances. Antonio Petalardo''s successful 1871 gambit on the opening of
        the [[Teatro Opera]], inspired others to fund the growing art in Argentina.\n\n===Cinema===\n{{main

        of countries and dependencies by population|32nd]] most populous country in
        the world.\n\nThe territory of modern Ukraine has been inhabited since 32,000
        BC. During the [[Middle Ages]], the area was a key centre of East Slavic culture,
        with the powerful state of [[Kievan Rus'']] forming the basis of Ukrainian
        identity. Following its fragmentation in the 13th century, the territory was
        contested, ruled and divided by a variety of powers, including [[Grand Duchy
        of Lithuania|Lithuania]], Poland, the [[Ottoman Empire]], [[Austria-Hungary]],
        and Russia. A [[Cossack Hetmanate|Cossack republic]] emerged and prospered
        during the 17th and 18th centuries, but its territory was eventually split
        between Poland and the [[Russian Empire]], and later merged fully into Russia.\n\nDuring
        the 20th century three periods of independence occurred.  The first of these
        periods occurred briefly during and immediately after the German occupation
        near the end of [[World War I]] and the second occurred, also briefly, and
        also during German occupation, during [[World War II]]. However, both of these
        first two earlier periods would eventually see Ukraine''s territories consolidated
        back into a [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet republic]] within
        the [[USSR]].  The third period of independence began in 1991, when Ukraine
        gained its independence from the Soviet Union in the aftermath of [[dissolution
        of the Soviet Union|its dissolution]] at the end of the [[Cold War]].  Ukraine
        has maintained its independence as a sovereign state ever since.  Before its
        independence, Ukraine was typically referred to in English as \"The Ukraine\",
        but sources since then have moved to drop \"the\" from the name of Ukraine
        in all uses.<ref name=UKrW812991TU />\n\nFollowing its independence, Ukraine

        estates in Ukraine, and were a law unto themselves. Judicial rulings from
        [[Cracow]] were routinely flouted, while peasants were heavily taxed and practically
        tied to the land as [[serf]]s. Occasionally the landowners battled each other
        using armies of Ukrainian peasants. The Poles and Lithuanians were Roman Catholics
        and tried with some success to convert the Orthodox lesser nobility. In 1596,
        they set up the \"Greek-Catholic\" or [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church|Uniate
        Church]]; it dominates western Ukraine to this day. Religious differentiation

        was one root cause of this revolt, which included Ukrainian [[Massacre of
        Uman|violence]] that killed tens of thousands of Poles and Jews. Religious
        warfare also broke out among Ukrainian groups. Increasing conflict between
        Uniate and Orthodox parishes along the newly reinforced Polish-Russian border
        on the [[Dnieper River]] in the time of [[Catherine II of Russia|Catherine
        II]] set the stage for the uprising. As Uniate religious practices had become
        more Latinized, Orthodoxy in this region drew even closer into dependence
        on the Russian Orthodox Church. Confessional tensions also reflected opposing
        Polish and Russian political allegiances.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Skinner

        meridian east|22\u00b0]] and [[41st meridian east|41\u00b0 E]].\n\nThe landscape
        of Ukraine consists mostly of fertile plains (or [[steppes]]) and plateaus,
        crossed by rivers such as the [[Dnieper River|Dnieper]] ({{lang|uk-Latn|''''Dnipro''''}}),
        [[Seversky Donets]], [[Dniester]] and the [[Southern Bug]] as they flow south
        into the [[Black Sea]] and the smaller [[Sea of Azov]]. To the southwest,
        the [[Danube Delta|delta]] of the [[Danube]] forms the border with Romania.
        Ukraine''s various regions have diverse geographic features ranging from the
        highlands to the lowlands. The country''s only mountains are the [[Carpathian
        Mountains]] in the west, of which the highest is the [[Hora Hoverla]] at {{convert|2061|m}},
        and the [[Crimean Mountains]] on Crimea, in the extreme south along the coast.<ref>{{cite

        the south-western spurs of the [[Central Russian Upland]] over which runs
        the border with the [[Russian Federation]]. Near the [[Sea of Azov]] can be
        found the Donets Ridge and the Near Azov Upland. The [[snow melt]] from the

        consisting of the black, extremely fertile Ukrainian ([[Chornozem|chernozems]])\n*
        a zone of chestnut and salinized soils\n\nAs much as two-thirds of the country''s
        surface land consists of the so-called black earth ([[chornozem]]), a resource
        that has made Ukraine one of the most fertile regions in the world and well
        known as a \"breadbasket\".<ref>Magocsi, Paul R. A history of Ukraine: The
        land and its peoples. University of Toronto Press, 2010.</ref> These ([[chornozem]])
        soils may be divided into three broad groups:\n\n* in the north a belt of
        the so-called deep chernozems, about {{convert|5|ft|m|abbr=off}} thick and
        rich in humus\n* south and east of the former, a zone of prairie, or ordinary,
        chernozems, which are equally rich in humus but only about {{convert|3|ft|m|abbr=off}}
        thick\n* the southernmost belt, which is even thinner and has still less humus\n\nInterspersed
        in various uplands and along the northern and western perimeters of the deep
        chernozems are mixtures of gray forest soils and podzolized black-earth soils,
        which together occupy much of Ukraine''s remaining area. All these soils are
        very fertile when sufficient water is available. However, their intensive
        cultivation, especially on steep slopes, has led to widespread soil erosion
        and gullying.\n\nThe smallest proportion of the soil cover consists of the
        chestnut soils of the southern and eastern regions. They become increasingly
        salinized to the south as they approach the Black Sea.<ref name=\"britannica.com\"

        divided{{by whom|date=August 2017}} into two main zoological areas. One of
        these areas, in the west of the country, is made up of the borderlands of
        Europe, where there are species typical of mixed forests, the other is located
        in eastern Ukraine, where steppe-dwelling species thrive. In the forested
        areas of the country it is not uncommon to find lynxes, wolves, wild boar
        and martens, as well as many other similar species; this is especially true
        of the [[Carpathian Mountains]], where a large number of predatory mammals
        make their home, as well as a contingent of brown bears. Around Ukraine''s
        lakes and rivers beavers, otters and mink make their home, whilst in the waters
        carp, bream and catfish are the most commonly found species of fish. In the
        central and eastern parts of the country, rodents such as hamsters and gophers
        are found in large numbers.\n\n==== Fungi ====\nMore than 6,600 [[species]]

        of its independence on 24 August 1991, and adoption of a constitution on 28
        June 1996, Ukraine became a semi-presidential republic. However, in 2004,
        deputies introduced changes to the Constitution, which tipped the balance
        of power in favour of a [[parliamentary system]]. From 2004 to 2010, the legitimacy
        of the 2004 Constitutional amendments had official sanction, both with the
        Constitutional Court of Ukraine, and most major political parties.<ref name=\"1oct\">{{cite

        and again making Ukraine''s political system more presidential in character.\n\nThe
        ruling on the 2004 Constitutional amendments became a major topic of political
        discourse. Much of the concern was based on the fact that neither the Constitution
        of 1996 nor the Constitution of 2004 provided the ability to \"undo the Constitution\",
        as the decision of the Constitutional Court would have it, even though the
        2004 constitution arguably has an exhaustive list of possible procedures for
        constitutional amendments (articles 154\u2013159). In any case, the current

        However, the President still retains the authority to nominate the Ministers
        of the Foreign Affairs and of Defence for parliamentary approval, as well
        as the power to appoint the [[Prosecutor General of Ukraine|Prosecutor General]]
        and the head of the [[Security Service of Ukraine|Security Service]].\n\nLaws,
        acts of the parliament and the cabinet, presidential decrees, and acts of
        the [[Verkhovna Rada of Crimea|Crimean parliament]] may be abrogated by the
        [[Constitutional Court of Ukraine|Constitutional Court]], should they be found
        to violate the constitution. Other normative acts are subject to judicial
        review. The [[Supreme Court of Ukraine|Supreme Court]] is the main body in
        the system of courts of general jurisdiction.\nLocal self-government is officially
        guaranteed. Local councils and city mayors are popularly elected and exercise
        control over local budgets. The heads of regional and district administrations
        are appointed by the President in accordance with the proposals of the Prime
        Minister. This system virtually requires an agreement between the President
        and the Prime Minister, and has in the past led to problems, such as when
        President Yushchenko exploited a perceived loophole by appointing so-called
        ''temporarily acting'' officers, instead of actual governors or local leaders,
        thus evading the need to seek a compromise with the Prime Minister. This practice
        was controversial and was subject to Constitutional Court review.\n\nUkraine
        has a large number of political parties, many of which have tiny memberships
        and are unknown to the general public.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

        Court justices are appointed by presidential decree for an initial period
        of five years, after which Ukraine''s Supreme Council confirms their positions
        for life. Although there are still problems, the system is considered to have
        been much improved since Ukraine''s independence in 1991. The Supreme Court
        is regarded as an independent and impartial body, and has on several occasions
        ruled against the Ukrainian government. The [[World Justice Project]] ranks

        Ukraine, {{As of|2010|lc=y}}, is 10.8 births/1,000 population, and the death
        rate is 15.2 deaths/1,000 population (see [[Demographics of Ukraine|Ukraine
        demographic tables]]).\n\nThe phenomenon of lowest-low fertility, defined
        as total fertility below 1.3, is emerging throughout Europe and is attributed
        by many to postponement of the initiation of childbearing. Ukraine, where
        total fertility (a very low 1.1 in 2001), was one of the world''s lowest,
        shows that there is more than one pathway to lowest-low fertility. Although
        Ukraine has undergone immense political and economic transformations during
        1991\u20132004, it has maintained a young age at first birth and nearly universal
        childbearing. Analysis of official national statistics and the Ukrainian Reproductive
        Health Survey show that fertility declined to very low levels without a transition
        to a later pattern of childbearing. Findings from focus group interviews suggest
        explanations of the early fertility pattern. These findings include the persistence
        of traditional norms for childbearing and the roles of men and women, concerns
        about medical complications and infertility at a later age, and the link between
        early fertility and early marriage.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Perelli-Harris

        in April 1918 in [[Kiev]] as an independent humanitarian society of the [[Ukrainian
        People''s Republic]]. Its immediate tasks were to help refugees and prisoners
        of war, care for handicapped people and orphaned children, fight famine and
        epidemics, support and organize sick quarters, hospitals and public canteens.
        At present, society involves more than 6.3 million supporters and activists.
        Its Visiting Nurses Service has 3,200 qualified nurses. The organization takes
        part in more than 40 humanitarian programmes all over Ukraine, which are mostly
        funded by public donation and corporate partnerships. By its own estimates,
        the Society annually provides services to more than 105,000 lonely, elderly
        people, about 23,000 people disabled during the Second World War and handicapped
        workers, more than 25,000 war veterans, and more than 8,000 adults handicapped
        since childhood. Assistance for orphaned and disabled children is also rendered.\n\nUkraine''s
        healthcare system is state subsidised and freely available to all Ukrainian
        citizens and registered residents. However, it is not compulsory to be treated

        higher education institutions (HEIs) emerged in Ukraine during the late 16th
        and early 17th centuries. The first Ukrainian higher education institution
        was the [[Ostroh Academy|Ostrozka School]], or Ostrozkiy Greek-Slavic-Latin
        Collegium, similar to Western European higher education institutions of the
        time. Established in 1576 in the town of [[Ostroh|Ostrog]], the Collegium
        was the first higher education institution in the [[East Slavic peoples|Eastern
        Slavic]] territories. The oldest university was the [[National University
        of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy|Kyiv Mohyla Academy]], first established in 1632 and
        in 1694 officially recognised by the government of [[Imperial Russia]] as
        a higher education institution. Among the oldest is also the [[Lviv University]],
        founded in 1661. More higher education institutions were set up in the 19th
        century, beginning with universities in [[Kharkiv University|Kharkiv]] (1805),
        [[Kiev University|Kiev]] (1834), [[Odessa University|Odessa]] (1865) and [[Chernivtsi
        University|Chernivtsi]] (1875) and a number of professional higher education

        Sciences in 1805), a Veterinary Institute (1873) and a [[Kharkiv Polytechnical

        exams and differentiated test suffice; this rule may be different in some
        universities. For highest grades, the scholarship is increased by 25%. For
        most students the government subsidy is not sufficient to cover their basic
        living expenses. Most universities provide subsidised housing for out-of-city
        students. Also, it is common for libraries to supply required books for all

        These repressions were part of Stalin''s implemented policy of [[socialist

        Tingui.jpg|thumb|right|Traditional Ukrainian village [[Ukrainian architecture|architecture]]
        in [[Curitiba]], Brazil, which has a large [[Ukrainian diaspora.]]]]\nUkrainian
        architecture includes the motifs and styles that are found in structures built
        in modern Ukraine, and by [[Ukrainians]] worldwide.\nThese include initial
        roots which were established in the [[Eastern Slavs|Eastern Slavic]] state
        of [[Kievan Rus'']]. Since the [[Christianization of Kievan Rus'']] for several
        ages Ukrainian architecture was influenced by the [[Byzantine architecture]].
        After the [[Mongol invasion of Rus|12th century]], the distinct [[architectural
        history]] continued in the principalities of [[Galicia-Volhynia]]. During
        the epoch of the [[Zaporozhian Cossacks]], a new style unique to Ukraine was
        developed under the western influences of the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]].
        After the union with the [[Tsardom of Russia]], many structures in the larger
        eastern, Russian-ruled area were built in the styles of [[Russian architecture]]
        of that period, whilst the western [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]] was
        developed under [[Architecture of Austria|Austro-Hungarian architectural influences]].
        Ukrainian national motifs would finally be used during the period of the [[Soviet
        Union]] and in modern independent Ukraine.\n\nThe great [[Architecture of
        Kievan Rus|churches of the Rus'']], built after the [[Baptism of Kievan Rus''|adoption
        of Christianity]] in 988, were the first examples of monumental architecture
        in the East Slavic lands. The architectural style of the Kievan state was
        strongly influenced by the [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine]]. Early [[Eastern
        Orthodox]] churches were mainly made of wood, with the simplest form of church
        becoming known as a [[cell church]]. Major cathedrals often featured scores
        of small domes, which led some art historians to take this as an indication
        of the appearance of pre-Christian pagan Slavic temples.\n\nSeveral examples
        of these churches survive; however, during the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries,
        many were externally rebuilt in the [[Ukrainian Baroque]] style (see below).
        Examples include the grand [[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kiev|St. Sophia of
        Kiev]]&nbsp;\u2013 the year 1017 is the earliest record of foundation laid,
        [[Church of the Saviour at Berestove]] \u2013 built from 1113 to 1125 and
        [[St. Cyril''s Monastery|St. Cyril''s Church]], circa 12th-century. All can
        still be found in the Ukrainian capital. Several buildings were reconstructed
        during the late-19th century, including the [[:File:WladimirWolynsk Uspenski
        Cathedral.jpeg|Assumption Cathedral]] in [[Volodymyr-Volynskyi]], built in
        1160 and reconstructed in 1896\u20131900, the [[:File:AX Chernigiv Pyatnitska
        Church.jpg|Paraskevi church in Chernihiv]], built in 1201 with reconstruction
        done in the late 1940s, and the [[Golden Gate (Kiev)|Golden gates in Kiev]],
        built in 1037 and reconstructed in 1982. The latter''s reconstruction was
        criticised by some art and architecture historians as a revivalist fantasy.
        Unfortunately little secular or [[vernacular architecture]] of [[Kievan Rus'']]
        has survived.\n\nAs Ukraine became increasingly integrated into the [[Russian
        Empire]], Russian architects had the opportunity to realise their projects
        in the picturesque landscape that many Ukrainian cities and regions offered.
        [[St. Andrew''s Church of Kiev]] (1747\u20131754), built by [[Bartolomeo Rastrelli]],
        is a notable example of [[Baroque]] architecture, and its location on top
        of the Kievan mountain made it a recognisable monument of the city. An equally
        notable contribution of Rasetrelli was the [[Mariyinsky Palace]], which was
        built to be a summer residence to Russian Empress [[Elizabeth of Russia|Elizabeth]].
        During the reign of the last [[Hetmans of Ukrainian Cossacks|Hetman of Ukraine]],
        [[Kirill Razumovsky]], many of the [[Cossack Hetmanate]]''s towns such as
        [[Hlukhiv]], [[Baturyn]] and [[Koselets]] had grandiose projects built by
        [[Andrey Kvasov]]. Russia eventually conquered the south of Ukraine and Crimea,
        and renamed them as [[New Russia]]. New cities such as [[Mykolayiv|Nikolayev]],
        [[Odessa]], [[Kherson]] and [[Sevastopol]] were founded. These would contain
        notable examples of Imperial Russian architecture.\n\n<center>\n<gallery>\nFile:\u0427\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0456\u0433\u0456\u0432.\u0421\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0440

        1934, the capital of Soviet Ukraine moved from [[Kharkiv]] to [[Kiev]]. Previously,
        the city was seen as only a regional centre, hence received little attention.
        All of that was to change, at great price. The first examples of [[Stalinist
        architecture]] were already showing, and, in light of the official policy,
        a new city was to be built on top of the old one. This meant that much-admired
        examples such as the [[St. Michael''s Golden-Domed Monastery]] were destroyed.
        Even the St. Sophia Cathedral was under threat. Also, the Second World War
        contributed to the wreckage. After the war, a new project for the reconstruction
        of central Kiev transformed [[Khreshchatyk]] avenue into a notable example
        of Stalinism in Architecture. However, by 1955, the new politics of architecture
        once again stopped the project from fully being realised.\n\nThe task for
        modern Ukrainian architecture is diverse application of modern aesthetics,
        the search for an architect''s own artistic style and inclusion of the existing
        historico-cultural environment. An example of modern Ukrainian architecture
        is the reconstruction and renewal of the [[Maidan Nezalezhnosti]] in central
        Kiev. Despite the limit set by narrow space within the plaza, the engineers
        were able to blend together the uneven landscape, and use underground space
        for a new shopping centre.\n\nA major project, which may take up most of the
        21st century, is the construction of the Kiev City-Centre on the [[Rybalskyi
        Peninsula]], which, when finished, will include a dense skyscraper park amid
        the picturesque landscape of the [[Dnieper River|Dnieper]].<ref name=gradsovet_05_12_07>{{cite

        Mamay 1st half of 19th c (4).jpg|thumb|[[Cossack Mamay]] playing a [[kobza]]]]\n\nMusic
        is a major part of Ukrainian culture, with a long history and many influences.
        From traditional [[folk music]], to [[classical music|classical]] and [[modern
        rock]], Ukraine has produced several internationally recognised musicians
        including [[Kirill Karabits]], [[Okean Elzy]] and [[Ruslana]]. Elements from
        traditional Ukrainian folk music made their way into Western music and even
        into modern [[jazz]].\n\n[[File:\u041b\u0438\u0441\u0435\u043d\u043a\u043e

        is widely considered to be the father of Ukrainian classical music{{citation
        needed|date=June 2015}}]]\n\nUkrainian music sometimes presents a perplexing
        mix of exotic melismatic singing with chordal harmony. The most striking general
        characteristic of authentic ethnic Ukrainian folk music is the wide use of
        minor modes or keys which incorporate augmented 2nd intervals.\n\nDuring the
        Baroque period, music was an important discipline for those that had received
        a higher education in Ukraine. It had a place of considerable importance in
        the curriculum of the [[Kyiv-Mohyla Academy]]. Much of the nobility was well
        versed in music with many Ukrainian Cossack leaders such as (Mazepa, Paliy,
        Holovatyj, Sirko) being accomplished players of the [[kobza]], [[bandura]]
        or [[torban]].\n\nThe first dedicated musical academy was set up in Hlukhiv,
        Ukraine in 1738 and students were taught to sing, play violin and bandura
        from manuscripts. As a result, many of the earliest composers and performers
        within the Russian empire were ethnically Ukrainian, having been born or educated
        in Hlukhiv, or had been closely associated with this music school.\nSee: [[Dmytro
        Bortniansky]], [[Maksym Berezovsky]] and [[Artemy Vedel|Artemiy Vedel]].\n\n[[File:Rapid
        Trident 2014 06.jpg|thumb|Ukrainian dance ''''[[hopak]]''''.]]\n\nUkrainian
        classical music falls into three distinct categories defined by whether the
        composer was of Ukrainian ethnicity living in Ukraine, a composer of non-Ukrainian
        ethnicity who was born or at some time was a citizen of Ukraine, or an ethnic
        Ukrainian living outside of Ukraine within the [[Ukrainian diaspora]]. The
        music of these three groups differs considerably, as do the audiences for
        whom they cater.\n\nSince the mid-1960s, Western-influenced pop music has
        been growing in popularity in Ukraine. Folk singer and harmonium player [[Mariana
        Sadovska]] is prominent. Ukrainian pop and folk music arose with the international
        popularity of groups and performers like [[Vopli Vidoplyasova]], [[Dakh Daughters]],
        [[Dakha Brakha]], [[Ivan Dorn]] and [[Okean Elzy]].\n\nModern musical culture
        of Ukraine is presented both with academic and entertainment music. Ukraine
        has five conservatories, 6 opera houses, five houses of Chamber Music, Philharmony
        in all regional centers.\n\nUkraine hosted the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2005]]
        and the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2017]].\n\n=== Cinema ===\n{{Main|Cinema
        of Ukraine}}\nUkraine has had an influence on the history of the cinema. Ukrainian
        directors [[Alexander Dovzhenko]], often cited as one of the most important
        early Soviet filmmakers, as well as being a pioneer of [[Soviet montage theory]],
        [[Dovzhenko Film Studios]], and [[Sergei Parajanov]], Armenian film director
        and artist who made significant contributions to Ukrainian, Armenian and Georgian
        cinema. He invented his own cinematic style, Ukrainian poetic cinema, which
        was totally out of step with the guiding principles of socialist realism.\n\n[[File:Muratova.jpg|upright|thumbnail|[[Kira
        Muratova]]]]\n\nOther important directors including [[Kira Muratova]], [[Larisa
        Shepitko]], [[Sergei Bondarchuk]], [[Leonid Bykov]], [[Yuri Ilyenko]], [[Leonid
        Osyka]], [[Ihor Podolchak]] with his [[Delirium (2013 film)|Delirium]] and
        [[Maryna Vroda]]. Many Ukrainian actors have achieved international fame and
        critical success, including: [[Vera Kholodnaya]], [[Bohdan Stupka]], [[Milla
        Jovovich]], [[Olga Kurylenko]], [[Mila Kunis]].\n\nDespite a history of important
        and successful productions, the industry has often been characterised by a
        debate about its identity and the level of European and Russian influence.
        Ukrainian producers are active in international co-productions and Ukrainian
        actors, directors and crew feature regularly in Russian (Soviet in past) films.
        Also successful films have been based on Ukrainian people, stories or events,
        including [[Battleship Potemkin]], [[Man with a Movie Camera]], [[Everything
        Is Illuminated (film)|Everything Is Illuminated]].\n\nUkrainian State Film
        Agency owns [[National Oleksandr Dovzhenko Film Centre]], film copying laboratory
        and archive, takes part in hosting of the [[Odessa International Film Festival]],

        of Ukraine. Freedom of the press in Ukraine is considered to be among the
        freest of the post-Soviet states other than the Baltic states.\n[[Freedom

        a significant national media centre. The National News Agency of Ukraine,
        [[Ukrinform]] was founded here in 1918. The Ukraine publishing sector, including

        in 1992.\n\nUkrainians listen to radio programming, such as [[Radio Ukraine]]
        or [[Radio Liberty]], largely commercial, on average just over two-and-a-half

        The top professional league is the [[Ukrainian Premier League|Vyscha Liha]]
        (\"premier league\").\n\nMany Ukrainians also played for the [[Soviet national
        football team]], most notably [[Ihor Belanov]] and [[Oleh Blokhin]], winners
        of the prestigious [[Ballon d''Or|Golden Ball Award]]. This award was only
        presented to one Ukrainian after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, [[Andriy
        Shevchenko]]. The national team made its debut in the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]],
        and reached the quarterfinals before losing to eventual champions, [[Italy
        national football team|Italy]]. Ukrainians also fared well in [[boxing]],
        where the brothers [[Vitali Klitschko|Vitali]] and [[Wladimir Klitschko]]
        have held world heavyweight championships.\n\n[[Sergey Bubka]] held the record
        in the [[Pole vault]] from 1993 to 2014; with great strength, speed and gymnastic
        abilities, he was voted the world''s best athlete on several occasions.<ref>{{cite

        in Ukraine. In 2011, Ukraine was granted a right to organize [[EuroBasket
        2015]]. Two years later the [[Ukraine national basketball team]] finished
        6th in [[EuroBasket 2013]] and qualified to [[2014 FIBA Basketball World Cup|FIBA
        World Cup]] for the first time in its history. [[Euroleague]] participant
        [[BC Budivelnyk|Budivelnyk Kyiv]] is the strongest professional basketball
        club in Ukraine.\n\n[[Chess]] is a popular sport in Ukraine. [[Ruslan Ponomariov]]
        is the former world champion. There are about 85 [[Grandmaster (chess)|Grandmasters]]
        and 198 [[International Masters]] in Ukraine.\n\nUkraine made its Olympic
        debut at the [[1994 Winter Olympics]]. So far, [[Ukraine at the Olympics]]
        has been much more successful in [[Summer Olympics]] (115 medals in five appearances)
        than in the [[Winter Olympics]]. Ukraine is currently ranked 35th by number
        of gold medals won in the [[All-time Olympic Games medal count]], with every
        country above it, except for Russia, having more appearances.{{citation needed|date=March
