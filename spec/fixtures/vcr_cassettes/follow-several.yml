        Patri\u00f3tica}}'''' (Patriotic Song). It has been called ''''Himno Nacional
        Argentino'''' since it was published with that name in 1847. Its lyrics were
        written by the Buenos Aires-born politician [[Vicente L\u00f3pez y Planes]]
        and the music was composed by the Spanish musician [[Blas Parera]].<ref>{{cite

        sole official song on May 11, 1813, three years after the [[May Revolution]];
        May 11 is therefore [[Anthem]] Day in Argentina.\n\nSome first, quite different,
        anthems were composed from 1810; a version was then introduced in 1813 which
        was used throughout the nineteenth century. The present, much shorter, anthem
        comprises only the first and last verses and the chorus of the 1813 Patriotic
        March, omitting much emotional text about the [[Argentine War of Independence|struggle
        for independence]] from [[Spain]] (''''with strong arms they tear to pieces
        the arrogant Iberian lion'''').\n\n==History==\n[[File:Versi\u00f3n francesa
        del Himno argentino.jpg|thumb|right|160px|French transcription for piano by
        Luis Messemaeckers, published in 1822. This is the oldest sheet found of the
        anthem outside Argentina.]]\nThe first anthem was the Patriotic March, published
        on 15 November 1810 in the ''''{{lang|es|[[Gazeta de Buenos Ayres]]}}''''.
        It had lyrics by Esteban de Luca and music by Blas Parera. This original anthem
        made no reference to the [[name of Argentina]] (the country was not formally
        named \"Rep\u00fablica Argentina\" until 1826, although it was referred to
        as such) or an independentist will, and talked instead about Spain being conquered
        by France in the [[Peninsular War]], the absolutist restoration begun by the
        Council of Regency, and the need to keep the republican freedoms achieved
        so far in the Americas: \"Spain was victim / of the plotting Gaul / because
        to the tyrants / she bent her neck / If there treachery / has doomed a thousands
        cities / let sacred freedom and union reign here / Let the father to the sons
        / be able to say / enjoy rights / that I did not enjoy\".<ref>{{cite book

        mid-1812, the ruling [[First Triumvirate (Argentina)|triumvirate]] ordered
        the [[Buenos Aires Cabildo]] to commission a national anthem. Cayetano Rodr\u00edguez,
        a Franciscan friar, wrote a text that was approved on 4 August. The Catalan
        musician Blas Parera, music director of the local theater, set it to music
        and performed it for the first time with the orchestra he conducted on 1 November.<ref>{{cite

        Aires |language=Spanish |pages=15\u201318}}</ref>\n\nLess than a year later
        the [[Asamblea del A\u00f1o XIII|Assembly of Year XIII]] estimated that the
        song was not effective enough to serve as a national anthem. On 6 March 1813
        several poets were asked to submit lyrics. The poem by the lawyer Vicente
        L\u00f3pez y Planes was unanimously considered the best. It was approved as
        the \"sole national march\" (''''{{lang|es|\u00fanica marcha nacional}}'''')
        on May 11, 1813. Parera was asked to compose a new musical setting around
        the same date. He must have finished the piece in a few days. Oral tradition
        has it that the premiere took place on May 14, 1813 at the home of the aristocrat
        [[Mariquita S\u00e1nchez|Mariquita S\u00e1nchez de Thompson]], but there is
        no documentary evidence of that.<ref>Galasso, p. 102.</ref> If this episode
        is true, then Parera, contrary to certain misconceptions, wrote quickly and
        under no visible coercion. The published song sheet is dated 14 May 1813.
        He again conducted the official premiere in the theater on May 28, and was
        paid 200 [[Argentine peso|pesos]].<ref>Vega, ''''El Himno Nacional Argentino'''',
        pp. 22\u201327.</ref>\n\n[[File:Partitura del Himno Nacional Argentino hallada
        en Bolivia.jpg|thumb|left|160px|[[Music sheet]] found in [[Santa Ana de Velasco]],
        [[Bolivia]], c. 1860.]]\nThe song includes a line that has given rise to controversy:
        ''''Buenos--Ayres se [o]pone \u00e1 la frente De los pueblos de la \u00ednclita
        union''''<!--spelling, double hyphen, and accents \u00e1 and union verbatim
        from original-->. In the manuscript and an early printed song-sheet the word
        ''''opone'''' is used; a slightly later version of the song-sheet correcting
        obvious errors such as spelling mistakes was issued with the same date of
        14 May 1813, but with ''''opone'''' changed to ''''pone''''. The meaning reverses:
        \"Buenos Aires ''''opposes'''' the front of the people of the union\" to \"Buenos
        Aires ''''positions itself at'''' the front ...\". The original ''''opone''''  has
        been interpreted as advancing part of the centralist views in Buenos Aires,
        but has also been considered a \"tragical misprint\".<ref name=scielo/> In
        many other lines the anthem goes beyond the [[Argentine War of Independence|Argentine
        theater]] of the [[Spanish American wars of independence]] and references
        events in Mexico, Central America, Northern South America, and Upper Peru.<ref>Galasso,
        pp. 102\u2013103.</ref> The growing ideas of independence are reflected in
        lines such as \"On the surface of the earth rises a glorious new nation, her
        head is crowned with laurels, and a Lion lies defeated at her feet\". This
        portrays not just Spanish absolutism, but Spain itself, as the enemy.<ref>Galasso,
        p. 103.</ref>\n\nThe composition was then known as ''''{{lang|es|Canci\u00f3n
        Patri\u00f3tica Nacional}}'''' (National Patriotic Song), and later simply
        as ''''{{lang|es|Canci\u00f3n Patri\u00f3tica}}'''' (Patriotic Song), but
        in [[Juan Pedro Esnaola]]''s early arrangement, dated around 1848, it appeared
        under the title ''''{{lang|es|Himno Nacional Argentino}}'''', and the name
        has been retained until today.<ref>Vega, ''''El Himno Nacional Argentino'''',
        pp. 88\u201389.</ref> In the complete version of the Anthem of May (as was
        christened by L\u00f3pez) it is noted that the political vision portrayed
        is not only Argentine, but Latin American. The lyrics are ardently pro-independence
        and anti-Spanish, as the country was at that time fighting for its independence
        from Spain.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nationalanthems.me/argentina-himno-nacional-argentino/

        |quote=The original lyrics of the anthem included harsh attacks on Spain,
        the former colonial power.}}</ref>\n\nThe song became popular immediately.
        Within ten years documented performances took place throughout Argentina,
        and also in Chile, Peru, and Colombia until they had their own anthems.<ref>Vega,
        ''''El Himno Nacional Argentino'''', pp. 30\u201341.</ref> Different versions
        emerged, making mass singing difficult; several reforms were then proposed.
        In 1860 Esnaola was commissioned to create an official version. He took the
        task to heart, making many changes to the music, including a slower tempo,
        a fuller texture, alterations to the melody, and enrichment of the harmony.
        In 1927 a committee produced a historicist version that undid several of Esnaola''s
        changes, but introduced new problems in the sung line. After a heated public
        debate fueled by the newspaper ''''{{lang|es|[[La Prensa (Buenos Aires)|La
        Prensa]]}}'''', this version was rejected and, following the recommendations
        of a second committee, Esnaola''s arrangement was officially reinstated.<ref>{{cite

        In 1944 it was confirmed as the official anthem.\n\nThroughout the 19th century
        the anthem was sung in its entirety. However, once harsh feelings against
        Spain had dissipated, and the country had become home to many Spanish immigrants,
        a modification was introduced by a decree of President [[Julio Argentino Roca]]
        on March 30, 1900:\n\n{{quote|''''\"Without producing alterations in the lyrics
        of the National Anthem, there are in it verses that perfectly describe the
        concept that nations universally have regarding their anthems in peaceful
        times, and that harmonize with the serenity and dignity of thousands of Spanish
        that share our living, those that can and must be preferred to be sung in
        official parties, for they respect the traditions and the law in no offense
        to anyone, the President of the Republic decrees that:''''\n\n''''In official
        or public parties, as well as in public schools, shall be sung only the first
        and last verses and the chorus of the National Song sanctioned by the General
        Assembly on May 11, 1813.\"''''}}\n\nThe words strongly attacking Spain were
        no longer sung.<ref>Buch, ''''O juremos con gloria morir'''', pp. 87\u201392.</ref>\n\n==Usage==\nPerformance
        of the anthem is mandatory during all official events, and Argentines in attendance
        are expected to stand up and sing it. [[Radio in Argentina|Radio]] broadcasters
        voluntarily perform the anthem at midnight, while [[Television in Argentina|TV
        channels]] do so before closing down their daily broadcast. On [[Public holidays
        in Argentina|national holidays]], it is mandatory to perform the anthem at
        midnight and noon.\n\nThe anthem is ruled in [[Law of Argentina|Argentine
        law]] by Decree 10302/1944.<ref name=Decree10302>\n{{cite web |url=http://servicios.infoleg.gob.ar/infolegInternet/verNorma.do?id=59311

        rock musician [[Charly Garc\u00eda]] broke legal regulations dealing with
        the reproduction of the song when he included an idiosyncratic [[cover version]]
        in his 1990 album ''''{{lang|es|Filosof\u00eda barata y zapatos de goma}}'''',
        stirring much controversy.<ref>Buch, ''''O juremos con gloria morir'''', pp.
        147\u2013156.</ref> In 1998 various [[Music of Argentina|Argentine artists]]
        reedited the anthem and other patriotic songs in the joint album ''''{{lang|es|El
        Grito Sagrado}}''''. Other singers followed on their footsteps recreating
        the piece in their own ways.\n\nA line from the original anthem was used as
        the Argentine title of the 1928 film known in English as ''''[[The Charge
        of the Gauchos]]''''.\n\nThe anthem appears at the beginning of the [[1985
        in film|1985]] movie ''''[[The Official Story]]'''', [[Academy Awards|Academy

        to the excessive length of the official version, in international events such
        as the [[Olympic Games]], professional [[Association football|soccer]] games,
        and the [[Rugby World Cup]], only the instrumental introduction (which lasts
        1 minute 6 seconds) is played. Another variation is to play the musical break

        of Argentina}}\nThe ''''''Constitution of Argentina'''''' is the basic governing
        document of [[Argentina]], and the primary source of existing [[Law of Argentina|law
        in Argentina]]. [[Argentine Constitution of 1853|Its first version]] was written
        in 1853 by a Constitutional Assembly gathered in [[Santa Fe, Argentina|Santa
        Fe]], and the doctrinal basis was taken in part from the [[United States Constitution]].
        It was then reformed in 1860, 1866, 1898, 1949, 1957 (which mainly repealed
        the 1949 reform), and the current version is the [[1994 reform of the Argentine
        Constitution|reformed text of 1994]].\n\n==History==\n[[Image:JuanBaustistaAlberdi.JPG|thumb|230px|[[Juan
        Bautista Alberdi]], the legal scholar who drafted the 1853 Constitution.]]
        \nThe first attempt to divide political power in [[Argentina]] was during
        the government created after the [[May Revolution]] (Spanish: Revoluci\u00f3n
        de Mayo): the [[Primera Junta]] could not create new taxes without the ''''Cabildo''''''s
        authorization.\n\nMany revolutionary leaders, led by [[Mariano Moreno]], wanted
        to declare independence immediately and to make a constitution in order to
        build an independent state. In October 1811, the [[Junta Grande]], which succeeded
        the Primera Junta, enacted the Regulation for the Division of Power, but it
        was not accepted by the [[First Triumvirate (Argentina)|executive power]].
        Nevertheless, the [[freedom of press]] and the Decree on Individual Security
        were accepted by November.\nIn 1813, the [[Asamblea del A\u00f1o XIII|General
        Constitutional Assembly]] was intended to declare a constitution but it could
        only declare the freedom for slaves'' sons.\n\nIn [[Argentine Constitution
        of 1819|1819]] and [[Argentine Constitution of 1826|1826]] were declared two
        constitutions that eventually failed because of the disagreement between [[Federales
        (Argentina)|Federals]] and [[Unitarian Party|Centralists]].\nMany other ''''constitutional''''
        pacts existed between 1820 and 1853 (when the current Argentine Constitution
        was enacted). The most important of them are: the [[Treaty of Pilar]] (1820),
        the [[Quadrilateral Treaty|Treaty of the ''''Cuadril\u00e1tero'''']] (1822),
        the [[Pacto Federal|Federal Pact]] (1831), the Palermo Protocol (1852), and
        the [[San Nicol\u00e1s Agreement|Treaty of San Nicol\u00e1s]] (1852).\n\nThe
        [[Pacto Federal|Federal Pact]] urged all the provinces to call a General Federal
        Congress, however this would have limited [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]]''s power
        who was the most powerful province governor, so the Congress was never called.\nWhen
        Rosas was defeated, in 1852, the [[San Nicol\u00e1s Agreement|Treaty of San
        Nicol\u00e1s]] finally called the Constitutional Congress that, in Santa Fe,
        on May 1, 1853, sworn to make effective the federal Constitution. Consequently,
        the [[Buenos Aires Province|Province of Buenos Aires]] left the [[Argentine
        Confederation]] until 1859.\n\n===Reforms to the 1853 Constitution===\nThe
        first constitutional amendment to the original 1853 text was performed in
        1860 after Buenos Aires rejoined the Argentine Confederation. It consisted
        of several changes to many of the original articles. One of the major changes
        was the renaming of the state: according to the reform, the country would
        be officially named ''''Rep\u00fablica Argentina'''' (\"Argentine Republic\")
        and, for legal purposes, ''''Naci\u00f3n Argentina'''' (\"Argentine Nation\"),
        replacing the older Argentine Confederation denomination in all articles of
        the constitution. Another important inclusion was the constitutional recognizing
        of Buenos Aires'' exclusive rights guaranteed by the Treaty of San Nicol\u00e1s.\n\nThe
        following reform was done in 1866 and established that exportation and importation
        taxes would be destined to the National Treasury indefinitely, no longer until
        1866 as the 1860 reform did.\n\nIn 1898, another minor constitutional amendment
        was approved. It allowed a more flexible ratio for proportional apportionment
        in the [[Argentine Chamber of Deputies|Chamber of Deputies]] and set the number
        of ministries to eight.\n\nDuring [[Juan Domingo Per\u00f3n]]''s government
        the [[Argentine Constitution of 1949]] was successfully passed, a major revision
        of the constitution. Its goal was to modernize and adapt the text to the twentieth
        century''s concepts of democracy, as for example, including a list of ''''social
        rights'''' including better working conditions for the working class, right
        to good education, etc. This also was included into the principles stated
        on the Preamble. Also, it permitted the indefinite reelection of the president.\n\nDuring
        the military regime known as the ''''[[Revoluci\u00f3n Libertadora]]'''' that
        had deposed Per\u00f3n''s government in 1955, in 1957 and before the elections
        that had to be held in 1958, a Constitutional Convention was elected to reform
        the constitution. This reform does not include 1949''s, implicitly annulling
        it so the text was based on the 1898 one. The only changes done were to include
        a summary of Per\u00f3n''s social articles known as ''''article 14 bis''''
        (existing currently) and to establish the necessity to have a Labour and Social
        Security Code.\n\nIn 1972, a \"Constitutional Amendment\" done by the military
        government led by general [[Alejandro A. Lanusse]] reformed the 1957 text.
        This had to last until 1977 but its application could be extended until 1981
        if no Constitutional Convention in 1976 decided either to accept it or reject
        it definitively. This amendment was not fully applied by the democratic government
        of Per\u00f3n in his third term nor by his wife [[Isabel Per\u00f3n]] acting
        as President after his death. Some changes were related to the size of Senate
        and one-term reelection of president and vice-president. Also reduced presidential,
        senatorial and deputies'' terms all to four years.\n\nThe last (and current)
        version of the Argentine Constitution was done by [[Carlos Sa\u00fal Menem]]
        in 1994. It included many of the modifications from the 1972 \"amendment\"
        as the growth of the Senate size (three per Province), one-term presidential
        reelection and reduction of its term to four years. It also made [[Buenos
        Aires|Buenos Aires City]] an [[Autonomous city|autonomous entity]] with its
        own authorities. Other changes were done to ensure a softer presidentialist
        regime, the inclusion of a new chapter into the Bill of Rights related to
        politics, health and environment, and also the adoption of a much faster legislative
        procedure for creating laws. In addition with the 1994 constitutional reform,
        the requirement of belonging to the Roman Catholic faith in order to be President
        or Vice President of the Republic, was also abolished.<ref>{{cite web|title=Argentina

        division types; Parts, Titles, Divisions and Chapters, though these need not
        be present all the time. For example, the First Part is divided into Chapters
        but not into Titles nor Sections. The scheme of the Constitution is the following:\n*Preamble\n*First
        Part (43 sections)\n**First Chapter ''''Declarations, rights and guarantees''''
        (35 sections)\n**Second Chapter ''''New rights and guarantees'''' (8 sections)\n*Second
        Part ''''Authorities of the Nation'''' (86 sections)\n**First Title ''''Federal

        Nacional Argentina 1853 - p\u00e1gina 1.jpeg|thumb|240px|left|''''\"Nos los
        Representantes del Pueblo de la Naci\u00f3n Argentina &hellip;\"'''']]\nThe
        Preamble of the Argentine Constitution states or implies, in short terms,
        a number of starting points for the conception of the nation, such as a representative
        government. It acknowledges previous agreements to create a constitution (in
        order to legitimize the gathering of the Assembly). Finally, it lays the foundations
        for the policy of support of [[immigration in Argentina|immigration]], by
        asking \"for the protection of [[God]], source of all reason and justice\"
        for all people who desire to inhabit Argentina.\n\n==Declarations, rights
        and guarantees ==\nThe Constitution establishes a Bill of Rights and Guarantees
        for all individuals, Argentine or foreign; the inviolability of the right
        of life, liberty, equality, security and property. The second chapter, added
        in 1994, deals with public ethics, political rights, environmental protection
        and consumer rights.\n\nCivil rights are recognized to all inhabitants with
        no distinction of nationality. This is a consequence of the traditional interest
        of Argentina in the affluence of foreigners and foreign investment. Labor
        rights are also acknowledged (this is part of the legacy of [[Peronism]],
        resulting in the 1949 and 1957 reforms). These include limited labor day,
        just salary, right of organization, social security benefits, etc.\n\nThe
        constitution declares that no one can be deprived of property, except in case
        of judicial sentence based on previously enacted legislation, or through expropriation
        for reasons of public utility, dully qualified by law and previously indemnified.
        The person, its judicial defense, its domicile and correspondence are inviolable.\n\nWhat
        the law does not forbid is permitted. Individuals have complete freedom to
        do or refuse to do anything in private, except if that interferes with public
        order or morality, or causes damage to third parties.\n\nThe 1994 reform introduces
        several new legal figures: ''''amparo judicial'''' (an [[injunction]]), ''''habeas
        corpus'''' and ''''habeas data''''. Injunctions are destined to protect citizens
        from actual or imminent damage; ''''[[habeas corpus (Argentine law)|habeas
        corpus]]'''' (known for a long time to Argentine jurisprudence, and related
        to the [[habeas corpus]] of [[Common Law]]) is to protect the citizen''s physical
        freedom; and ''''[[habeas data (Argentine law)|habeas data]]'''' is a person''s
        right to access information about himself or herself, and request its confidentiality,
        a change or a suppression.\n\nThe Argentine Constitution''s rights are divided
        in four groups: Civil, patrimonial, politic and social.\n\n===Declarations===\nDeclarations
        state the basis that hold the nation''s politics and define it as an independent
        entity, for example, Article 1 states that the government is representative,
        republican and federal and Article 35 lists the Country''s official names.\n\n===Guarantees===\nThey
        are institutional methods to protect the exercise of fundamental rights. They
        are so important that it is possible to say that a right can be held as long
        as it has a guarantee to protect it.\nMost of Guarantees are in the sections
        18 and 43, between these are: habeas corpus, the abolition of death penalty
        and torture.\n\n===Rights===\nThe Argentine Constitution''s rights are divided
        in four groups: Civil, patrimonial, politic and social.\n\n* ''''''Civil''''''
        rights are related to the people as individuals. Some examples are: right
        to live, have honor, have a name, make associations and to express opinions.\n*
        ''''''Patrimonial'''''' rights protect men in relation to their goods. Some
        examples are: to own, to sell and to hire and build legal industries.\n* ''''''Politic''''''
        rights allow people to take part in the government, by themselves or by electing
        representatives: this category includes the right to choose and be chosen
        for the government and to make or join a political party.\n* ''''''Social''''''
        rights are related to people as part of society: these are (among many others)
        the rights to work, to have fair wages, to know, to learn, to teach.\n\nIn
        [[Argentina]], Freedom is one of the most important rights. Section 19 says
        that private actions of men that don''t harm the public order or another man
        can not be judged by authorities. Moreover, it holds the \"principle of legality\":
        ''''No inhabitant of the Nation will be forced to do what the law doesn''t
        order nor forbidden to do what the law doesn''t forbid''''.\nEquality is as
        important as freedom. Section 16 states that in the country there are no noble
        titles and \"all its inhabitants are equal before the law\"\n\n==Form of government==\nAccording
        to the Constitution, Argentina is a representative [[federalism|federal]]
        [[republic]], divided in [[provinces of Argentina|provinces]], [[municipality|municipalities]],
        and the Autonomous City of [[Buenos Aires]]. Each province has the right and
        duty to dictate its own constitution, respecting the same principles as the
        national constitution.\n\n==Divisions of government powers==\n[[Image:Edificio
        del Congreso en Buenos Aires 2004.JPG|thumb|250px|Congress building in Buenos
        Aires, Argentina]]\nThe Constitution mandates a strict separation of government
        powers, into three branches (Executive, Legislative, and Judicial) and the
        Public Ministry.\n\n===Executive===\nThe Executive Branch is formed by the
        [[President of Argentina|President]] (Art. 87). The Vice-president replaces
        the President in case of illness, absence from the capital, death, resignation,
        or removal.\n\nThe Vice-President doesn''t belong to the executive branch.
        Curiously, it belongs to the legislative branch since he is also the president
        of the senate. (Art. 57)\n\nThe President promulgates the laws sanctioned
        by Congress, and has veto power over them. The President directs international
        relations and is the Commander in Chief of the Army. In some cases, the President
        can issue [[Necessity and Urgency Decree|emergency decrees]].\n\n===Legislative===\nThe
        Legislative Branch is composed of the Vice-President, a bicameral Congress,
        the General Auditing Office of the Nation and the Ombudsman. Congress is divided
        in two Houses: ''''C\u00e1mara de Diputados'''' ([[Argentine Chamber of Deputies|Chamber
        of Deputies]], the Lower House) and ''''C\u00e1mara de Senadores'''' ([[Argentine
        Senate|Senate]], the Upper House).\n\nThe Vice-President belongs in the Legislative
        Branch since he (or she) is also the President of the Senate Chamber.\n\nThe
        General Auditing Office of the Nation is a technical advisory body of Congress
        with functional autonomy.\n\nThe Ombudsman is an independent body which works
        without receiving instructions from any authority. The mission of the Ombudsman
        is the defense and protection of human rights, civil rights and guarantees,
        and the control of the Administration.\n\n===Judicial===\nThe Judicial Branch
        is formed by the Supreme Court, and lower courts throughout the country. The
        Supreme Justices and all judges hold their offices as long as they are not
        deposed for misbehavior.\n\n===Public Ministry===\nThe Public Ministry is
        an independent body with functional autonomy and financial autarchy, with
        the function of promoting justice for the defense of legality, of the general
        interests of society, in coordination with the other authorities of the Republic.\n\nIt
        is composed of an Attorney General of the Nation and an Ombudsman General
        of the Nation, and such other members as the law may establish.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Argentine
