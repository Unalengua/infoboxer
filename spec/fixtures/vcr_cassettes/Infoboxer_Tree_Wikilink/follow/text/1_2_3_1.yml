        comes from the [[Spanish language]], however the naming itself is not Spanish,
        but [[Italian language|Italian]]. ''''Argentina'''' ([[Grammatical gender|masculine]]
        ''''argentino'''') means in Italian \"(made) of silver, silver coloured\",
        probably borrowed from the  [[French language|Old French]] adjective ''''argentine''''
        \"(made) of silver\" > \"silver coloured\" already mentioned in the 12th century.<ref>[http://www.cnrtl.fr/etymologie/argentin
        Etymology of ''''argentin / -e'''' (French)]</ref> The French word ''''argentine''''
        is the [[Grammatical gender|feminine]] form of ''''argentin'''' and derives
        from ''''argent'''' \"silver\" with the [[suffix]] ''''-in'''' (same construction
        as Old French ''''acerin'''' \"(made) of steel\", from ''''acier'''' \"steel\"
        + ''''-in'''' or ''''sapin'''' \"(made) of fir wood\", from OF ''''sap''''
        \"fir\" + ''''-in''''). The Italian naming \"Argentina\" for the country implies
        ''''Argentina Terra'''' \"land of silver\" or ''''Argentina costa'''' \"coast
        of silver\". In Italian, the adjective or the [[proper noun]] is often used
        in an autonomous way as a substantive and replaces it and it is said ''''l''Argentina''''
        (It cannot be for the proper noun in French for example).\n\nThe name ''''Argentina''''
        was probably first given by the Venetian and Genoese navigators, such as [[Giovanni
        Caboto]]. In Spanish and Portuguese, the words for \"silver\" are respectively
        ''''plata'''' and ''''prata'''' and \"(made) of silver\" is said ''''plateado''''
        and ''''prateado''''. ''''Argentina'''' was first associated with the [[Sierra
        de la Plata|silver mountains legend]], widespread among the first European
        explorers of the [[La Plata Basin]].{{sfnm|1a1=Rock|1y=1987|1pp=6, 8|2a1=Edwards|2y=2008|2p=7}}\n\nThe

        War.\n\nOngan\u00eda shut down Congress, banned all political parties and
        dismantled student and worker unions. In 1969, popular discontent led to two
        massive protests: the ''''[[Cordobazo]]'''' and the ''''[[Rosariazo]]''''.

        to Viceroy [[Juan Jos\u00e9 de V\u00e9rtiz y Salcedo]]''s creation of the
        colony''s first theatre, ''''La Rancher\u00eda'''', in 1783. In this stage,
        in 1786, a tragedy entitled ''''Siripo'''' had its premiere. ''''Siripo''''
        is now a lost work (only the second act is conserved), and can be considered
        the first Argentine stage play, because it was written by Buenos Aires poet
        Manuel Jos\u00e9 de Lavard\u00e9n, it was premiered in Buenos Aires, and its
        plot was inspired by an historical episode of the early colonization of the
        [[R\u00edo de la Plata Basin]]: the destruction of [[Sancti Spiritu (Argentina)|Sancti
        Spiritu]] colony by aboriginals in 1529. ''''La Rancher\u00eda'''' theatre
        operated until its destruction in a fire in 1792. The second theatre stage
        in Buenos Aires was [[Teatro Coliseo]], opened in 1804 during the term of
        Viceroy [[Rafael de Sobremonte]]. It was the nation''s longest-continuously
        operating stage. The musical creator of the Argentine National Anthem, [[Blas
        Parera]], earned fame as a theatre score writer during the early 19th century.
        The genre suffered during the regime of [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]], though it
        flourished alongside the economy later in the century. The national government
        gave Argentine theatre its initial impulse with the establishment of the [[Col\u00f3n
        Theatre]], in 1857, which hosted classical and operatic, as well as stage
        performances. Antonio Petalardo''s successful 1871 gambit on the opening of

        to the east and the Pacific Ocean to the west. It borders [[Peru]] to the
        north, [[Bolivia]] to the northeast, [[Argentina]] to the east, and the [[Drake

        of [[Juan Fern\u00e1ndez Islands|Juan Fern\u00e1ndez]], [[Salas y G\u00f3mez]],
        [[Desventuradas Islands|Desventuradas]], and [[Easter Island]] in [[Oceania]].
        Chile also claims about {{convert|1250000|km2}} of [[Antarctica]], although

        The relatively small central area dominates in terms of population and agricultural
        resources, and is the cultural and political center from which Chile expanded
        in the late 19th century when it incorporated its northern and southern regions.
        Southern Chile is rich in forests and grazing lands, and features a string
        of [[volcano]]es and lakes. The southern coast is a labyrinth of [[Fjords

        They fought against the Sapa Inca Tupac Yupanqui and his army. The result
        of the bloody three-day confrontation known as the [[Battle of the Maule]]
        was that the Inca conquest of the territories of Chile ended at the [[Maule

        article|Conquest of Chile|Colonial Chile}}\nIn 1520, while attempting to circumnavigate
        the globe, [[Ferdinand Magellan]] discovered the southern passage now named
        after him, the [[Strait of Magellan]], thus becoming the first European to
        set foot on what is now Chile. The next Europeans to reach Chile were Diego
        de Almagro and his band of Spanish conquistadors, who came from Peru in 1535
        seeking gold. The Spanish encountered various cultures that supported themselves
        principally through slash-and-burn agriculture and hunting.<ref name=\"countrystudies\"/>\n\nThe
        conquest of Chile began in earnest in 1540 and was carried out by [[Pedro
        de Valdivia]], one of [[Francisco Pizarro]]''s lieutenants, who founded the
        city of Santiago on 12 February 1541. Although the Spanish did not find the
        extensive gold and silver they sought, they recognized the agricultural potential
        of Chile''s central valley, and Chile became part of the [[Spanish Empire]].<ref
        name=\"countrystudies\"/>\n\n[[File:Pedro de Valdivia.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Pedro
        de Valdivia]], Spanish ''''[[conquistador]]'''' and the first royal governor
        of Chile.]]\n\nConquest took place gradually, and the Europeans suffered repeated
        setbacks. A massive Mapuche insurrection that began in 1553 resulted in Valdivia''s
        death and the destruction of many of the colony''s principal settlements.
        Subsequent major insurrections took place in 1598 and in 1655. Each time the
        Mapuche and other native groups revolted, the southern border of the colony
        was driven northward. The abolition of [[slavery]] by the Spanish crown in
        1683 was done in recognition that enslaving the Mapuche intensified resistance
        rather than cowing them into submission. Despite royal prohibitions, relations
        remained strained from continual colonialist interference.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/storiadellaguer00caivgoog/storiadellaguer00caivgoog_djvu.txt

        off to the north by desert, to the south by the Mapuche, to the east by the
        Andes Mountains, and to the west by the ocean, Chile became one of the most
        centralized, homogeneous colonies in Spanish America. Serving as a sort of
        frontier [[garrison]], the colony found itself with the mission of forestalling
        encroachment by both the Mapuche and Spain''s European enemies, especially
        the [[British Empire|British]] and the Dutch. Buccaneers and English adventurers
        menaced the colony in addition to the Mapuche, as was shown by [[Sir Francis
        Drake]]''s 1578 raid on Valpara\u00edso, the colony''s principal port. Chile
        hosted one of the largest standing armies in the Americas, making it one of
        the most militarized of the Spanish possessions, as well as a [[Real Situado|drain
        on the treasury of the Viceroyalty of Peru]].<ref name=\"hudson\"/>\n\nThe
        first general census was conducted by the government of [[Agust\u00edn de
        J\u00e1uregui]] between 1777 and 1778; it indicated that the population consisted
        of 259,646 inhabitants: 73.5 percent of [[White Latin American|European descent]],
        7.9 percent [[mestizo]]s, 8.6 percent [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous
        peoples]] and 9.8 percent blacks. Francisco Hurtado, Governor of the province
        of [[Chilo\u00e9 Province|Chilo\u00e9]], conducted a census in 1784 and found
        the population consisted of 26,703 inhabitants, 64.4 percent of whom were
        whites and 33.5 percent of whom were natives.\n\nThe Diocese of [[Concepci\u00f3n,

        of the province of Chilo\u00e9. The population is estimated at 210,567, 86.1
        percent of whom were [[Spanish Chilean|Spanish]] or of European descent, 10
        percent of whom were indigenous and 3.7 percent of whom were mestizos, blacks

        enthronement of his brother [[Joseph Bonaparte|Joseph]] as the [[Spanish monarchy|Spanish
        King]] precipitated the drive by the colony for [[Chilean War of Independence|independence
        from Spain]]. A national junta in the name of [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|Ferdinand]]
        \u2013 heir to the deposed king \u2013 was formed on 18 September 1810. The
        [[Government Junta of Chile (1810)|Government Junta of Chile]] proclaimed
        Chile an autonomous republic within the Spanish monarchy (in memory of this
        day Chile celebrates its [[Fiestas Patrias (Chile)|National Day]] on 18 September
        each year).\n\nAfter these events, a movement for total independence, under
        the command of [[Jos\u00e9 Miguel Carrera]] (one of the most renowned patriots)
        and his two brothers Juan Jos\u00e9 and [[Luis Carrera]], soon gained a wider
        following. Spanish attempts to re-impose arbitrary rule during what was called
        the [[Reconquista (Spanish America)|Reconquista]] led to a prolonged struggle,
        including infighting from [[Bernardo O''Higgins]], who challenged Carrera''s
        leadership.\n\nIntermittent warfare continued until 1817. With Carrera in
        prison in Argentina, O''Higgins and anti-Carrera cohort [[Jos\u00e9 de San
        Mart\u00edn]], hero of the [[Argentine War of Independence]], led [[Army of
        the Andes|an army]] that [[Crossing of the Andes|crossed the Andes]] into
        Chile and defeated the royalists. On 12 February 1818 [[Chilean Declaration
        of Independence|Chile was proclaimed an independent republic]]. The political
        revolt brought little social change, however, and 19th-century Chilean society
        preserved the essence of the stratified colonial social structure, which was
        greatly influenced by family politics and the Roman Catholic Church. A strong
        presidency eventually emerged, but wealthy landowners remained powerful.<ref
        name=\"countrystudies\"/>\n\nChile slowly started to expand its influence
        and to establish its borders. By the Tantauco Treaty, the archipelago of Chilo\u00e9
        was incorporated in 1826. The economy began to boom due to the discovery of
        silver ore in Cha\u00f1arcillo, and the growing trade of the port of Valpara\u00edso,
        which led to conflict over maritime supremacy in the Pacific with Peru. At
        the same time, attempts were made to strengthen sovereignty in southern Chile
        intensifying [[Occupation of Araucan\u00eda|penetration into Araucan\u00eda]]
        and [[German colonization of Valdivia, Osorno and Llanquihue|colonizing Llanquihue
        with German immigrants]] in 1848. Through the founding of [[Fort Bulnes]]
        by the [[Schooner Ancud]] under the command of [[John Williams Wilson]], the
        Magallanes region joined the country in 1843, while the Antofagasta area,
        at the time part of, Bolivia, began to fill with people.\n\n[[File:Sinking

        during the [[War of the Pacific]]: The [[Battle of Iquique]] on 21 May 1879]]\n\nToward
        the end of the 19th century, the government in Santiago consolidated its position
        in the south by the [[Occupation of Araucan\u00eda]]. The [[Boundary treaty
        of 1881 between Chile and Argentina]] confirmed Chilean sovereignty over the
        Strait of Magellan. As a result of the [[War of the Pacific]] with Peru and
        Bolivia (1879\u201383), Chile expanded its territory northward by almost one-third,
        eliminating Bolivia''s access to the Pacific, and acquired valuable [[Caliche
        (mineral)#Chilean caliche|nitrate]] deposits, the exploitation of which led
        to an era of national affluence. Chile had joined the stand as one of the
        high-income countries in South America by 1870.<ref>{{cite book|author=Baten,

        Civil War]] brought about a redistribution of power between the President
        and Congress, and Chile established a parliamentary style democracy. However,
        the Civil War had also been a contest between those who favored the development
        of local industries and powerful Chilean banking interests, particularly the
        House of Edwards who had strong ties to foreign investors. Soon after, the
        country engaged in a [[Argentine\u2013Chilean naval arms race|vastly expensive

        the interests of a ruling [[oligarchy]]. By the 1920s, the emerging middle
        and working classes were powerful enough to elect a reformist president, [[Arturo
        Alessandri]], whose program was frustrated by a conservative congress. In

        in 1924 set off a period of political instability that lasted until 1932.
        Of the ten governments that held power in that period, the longest lasting
        was that of General [[Carlos Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez del Campo]], who briefly held
        power in 1925 and then again between 1927 and 1931 in what was a de facto
        dictatorship (although not really comparable in harshness or corruption to
        the type of military dictatorship that has often bedeviled the rest of Latin

        relinquishing power to a democratically elected successor, Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez
        del Campo retained the respect of a large enough segment of the population
        to remain a viable politician for more than thirty years, in spite of the
        vague and shifting nature of his ideology. When constitutional rule was restored
        in 1932, a strong middle-class party, the Radicals, emerged. It became the
        key force in coalition governments for the next 20 years. During the period
        of [[Radical Party (Chile)|Radical Party]] dominance (1932\u201352), the state
        increased its role in the economy. In 1952, voters returned Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez
        del Campo to office for another six years. [[Jorge Alessandri]] succeeded
        Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez del Campo in 1958, bringing Chilean conservatism back into
        power democratically for another term.\n\nThe [[Chilean presidential election,

        a period of major reform. Under the slogan \"Revolution in Liberty\", the
        Frei administration embarked on far-reaching social and economic programs,
        particularly in education, housing, and [[agrarian reform]], including rural
        unionization of agricultural workers. By 1967, however, Frei encountered increasing
        opposition from leftists, who charged that his reforms were inadequate, and
        from conservatives, who found them excessive. At the end of his term, Frei
        had not fully achieved his party''s ambitious goals.<ref name=\"countrystudies\">{{cite

        northern [[Atacama Desert]] contains great mineral wealth, primarily [[Copper#Production|copper]]
        and [[Caliche (mineral)#Chilean caliche|nitrate]]s. The relatively small Central
        Valley, which includes Santiago, dominates the country in terms of population
        and agricultural resources. This area is also the historical center from which
        Chile expanded in the late 19th century, when it integrated the northern and
        southern regions. Southern Chile is rich in forests, grazing lands, and features
        a string of volcanoes and lakes. The southern coast is a labyrinth of fjords,
        inlets, canals, twisting peninsulas, and islands. The Andes Mountains are
        located on the eastern border.\n\n<gallery mode=packed heights=135 style=\"font-size:88%;line-height:120%\">\nMiscanti

        flora and fauna of Chile are characterized by a high degree of endemism, due
        to its particular geography. In continental Chile, the [[Atacama Desert]]
        in the north and the [[Andes Mountains|Andes mountains]] to the east are barriers
        that have led to the isolation of flora and fauna. Add to that the enormous
        length of Chile (over {{convert|4300|km|0|abbr=on}}) and this results in a
        wide range of climates and environments that can be divided into three general
        zones: the desert provinces of the north, central Chile, and the humid regions
        of the south.\n\n===Flora===\n[[File:Araucaria araucana - Parque Nacional

        Chile belonged to the continental block called Gondwana. It was just a depression
        accumulated marine sediments began to rise at the end of the Mesozoic, 66
        million years ago, due to the collision between the Nazca and South American
        plates, resulting in the Andes. The territory would be shaped by millions
        of years due to the folding of the rocks, forming the current relief.\n\nThe
        Chilean relief consists of the central depression, which crosses the country
        longitudinally, flanked by two mountain ranges that make up about 80% of the
        territory: the Andes mountains to the east-natural border with [[Bolivia]]
        and [[Argentina]], with its most alton 18 located on the [[Nevado Ojos del
        Salado]], at 6891.3 m, the highest volcano in the world, in the [[Atacama
        Region|region of Atacama]] and Coastal Range west-minor height from the Andes,
        with its highest point located on the hill Vicu\u00f1a Mackenna, at 3114 meters,
        located in the Sierra Vicu\u00f1a Mackenna, the south of [[Antofagasta Region|Antofagasta]].
        Among the coastal mountains and the Pacific is a series of coastal plains,
        of variable length, which allow the settlement of coastal towns and big ports.
        Some areas of the plains territories encompass territory east of the Andes,
        and the Patagonian steppes and Magellan, or are high plateaus surrounded by
        high mountain ranges, such as the Altiplano or Puna de Atacama.\n\nThe [[Far
        North, Chile|Far North]] is the area between the northern boundary of the
        country and the [[Parallel (geometry)|parallel]] 26\u00b0 S, covering the
        first three regions. It is characterized by the presence of the [[Atacama
        desert]], the most arid in the world. The desert is fragmented by streams
        that originate in the area known as the [[Pampa del Tamarugal|pampas Tamarugal]].
        The Andes, split in two and whose eastern arm runs [[Bolivia]], has a high
        altitude and volcanic activity, which has allowed the formation of the Andean
        altiplano and salt structures as the [[Salar de Atacama]], due to the gradual
        accumulation of sediments over time.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:left;

        the south is the [[Norte Chico, Chile|Norte Chico]], extending to the [[Aconcagua
        River|Aconcagua river]]. Los Andes begin to decrease its altitude to the south
        and closer to the coast, reaching 90&nbsp;km away at the height of [[Illapel]],
        the narrowest part of the Chilean territory. The two mountain ranges intersect,
        virtually eliminating the intermediate depression. The existence of rivers
        flowing through the territory allows the formation of [[Transverse Valleys|transverse
        valleys]], where agriculture has developed strongly in recent times, while
        the [[coastal plains]] begin to expand.\n\nThe [[Zona Central, Chile|Central]]
        area is the most populated region of the country. The coastal plains are wide
        and allow the establishment of cities and ports along the Pacific, while the
        coastal mountains down its height. The Andes maintains altitudes above 6000m
        but descend slowly starts approaching the 4000 meters on average. The intermediate
        depression reappears becoming a fertile valley that allows agricultural development
        and human settlement, due to sediment accumulation. To the south, the Cordillera
        de la Costa reappears in the [[Nahuelbuta Range|range of Nahuelbuta]] while
        glacial sediments originate a series of lakes in the area of [[La Frontera,
        Chile|La Frontera]].\n\nPatagonia extends from within Reloncavi, at the height
        of parallel 41 \u00b0 S, to the south. During the [[Llanquihue glaciation|last
        glaciation]], this area was covered by ice that strongly eroded Chilean relief
        structures. As a result, the intermediate depression sinks in the sea, while
        the coastal mountains rise to a series of archipelagos, such as [[Chilo\u00e9
        Island|Chilo\u00e9]] and the [[Chonos Archipelago|Chonos]], disappearing in
        Taitao peninsula, in the parallel 47 \u00b0 S. The Andes mountain range loses
        height and erosion caused by the action of glaciers has caused [[fjords]].\n\nEast
        of the Andes, on the continent, or north of it, on the [[Tierra del Fuego
        (main island)|island of Tierra del Fuego]] are located relatively flat plains,
        which in the Strait of Magellan cover large areas.\n\nThe Andes, as he had
        done previously Cordillera de la Costa, begins to break in the ocean causing
        a myriad of islands and islets and disappear into it, sinking and reappearing
        in the Southern Antilles arc and then the Antarctic Peninsula, where it is
        called Antartandes, in the Chilean Antarctic Territory, lying between the
        meridians 53 \u00b0 W and 90 \u00b0 W.\n\nIn the middle of the Pacific, the
        country has sovereignty over several islands of volcanic origin, collectively
        known as Insular Chile. Of these, we highlight the archipelago of Juan Fernandez
        and Easter Island, which is located in the fracture zone between the Nazca
        plate and the Pacific plate known as East Pacific Rise.\n\n===Hydrography===\n{|

        serve for eight years with staggered terms, while deputies are elected every
        4 years. The last congressional elections were held on 17 November 2013, concurrently
        with the presidential election. The current Senate has a 21\u201315 split
        in favor of the governing coalition and 2 independents. The current lower
        house, the Chamber of Deputies, contains 67 members of the governing center-left
        coalition, 48 from the center-right opposition and 5 from small parties or
        independents. The Congress is located in the port city of Valpara\u00edso,
        about {{convert|140|km|0|abbr=off}} west of the capital, Santiago.\n[[File:Congresschile.jpg|thumb|[[National

        congressional elections are governed by a [[Binomial System|binomial system]]
        that, for the most part, rewards the two largest representations equally,
        often regardless of their relative popular support. Parties are thus forced
        to form wide coalitions and, historically, the two largest coalitions (Concertaci\u00f3n
        and Alianza) split most of the seats. Only if the leading coalition ticket
        out-polls the second place coalition by a margin of more than 2-to-1 does
        the winning coalition gain both seats, which tends to lock the legislative
        in a roughly 50-50 split.\n\nChile''s judiciary is independent and includes
        a court of appeal, a system of military courts, a constitutional tribunal,
        and the [[Supreme Court of Chile]]. In June 2005, Chile completed a nationwide

        independence, Chile has always had an active involvement in foreign affairs.
        In 1837 the country aggressively challenged the dominance of Peru''s port
        of [[Callao]] for preeminence in the Pacific trade routes, defeating the short-lived
        alliance between Peru and Bolivia, the [[Peru-Bolivian Confederation]] (1836\u201339)
        in the [[War of the Confederation]]. The war dissolved the confederation while
        distributing power in the Pacific. A second international war, the [[War of
        the Pacific]] (1879\u201383), further increased Chile''s regional role, while
        adding considerably to its territory.<ref name=\"hudson\"/>\n\nDuring the
        19th century, Chile''s commercial ties were primarily with Britain, a nation
        that had a major influence on the formation of the Chilean navy. The French
        influenced Chile''s legal and educational systems and had a decisive impact
        on Chile, through the architecture of the capital in the boom years at the
        turn of the 20th century. German influence came from the organization and
        training of the army by [[Prussia]]ns.<ref name=\"hudson\"/>\n\nOn 26 June
        1945, Chile participated as a founding member of the United Nations being
        among 50 countries that signed the [[United Nations Charter]] in San Francisco,
        California.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/members/list.shtml#c |title=United

        to democracy in 1990, Chile has been an active participant in the international
        political arena. Chile completed a 2-year non-permanent position on the UN
        Security Council in January 2005. Jose Miguel Insulza, a Chilean national,
        was elected Secretary General of the Organization of American States in May
        2005 and confirmed in his position, being re-elected in 2009. Chile is currently
        serving on the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Board of Governors,
        and the 2007\u20132008 chair of the board is Chile''s ambassador to the IAEA,
        Milenko E. Skoknic. The country is an active member of the UN family of agencies

        with most countries. It settled all its territorial disputes with Argentina
        during the 1990s except for part of the border at [[Southern Patagonian Ice

        desire to regain sovereign access to the Pacific Ocean it lost to Chile in

        ''''RM'''' (''''Regi\u00f3n Metropolitana''''). Two new regions were created
        in 2006 and became operative in October 2007; Los R\u00edos in the south (Region

        conditions are considered Chile''s main comparative advantages. However, Chile''s

        tourism grew by 13.6 percent, generating more than 4.5 billion dollars of
        which 1.5 billion was attributed to foreign tourists. According to the National
        Service of Tourism (Sernatur), 2 million people a year visit the country.
        Most of these visitors come from other countries in the American continent,
        mainly [[Argentina]]; followed by a growing number from the United States,
        Europe, and [[Brazil]] with a growing number of Asians from [[South Korea]]

        of its proximity to Santiago, the coast of the Valpara\u00edso Region, with
        its many beach resorts, receives the largest number of tourists. [[Vi\u00f1a

        cultural activities. Throughout the colonial period following the conquest,
